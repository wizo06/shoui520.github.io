<p>Welcome to the Japanese FAQ. This is probably the most complete Japanese FAQ you can find anywhere.</p>
<p>Due to the FAQ becoming ridiculously long, it can be hard to quickly find what you want. In that case, use the search bar or <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-control">Ctrl</kbd><span>+</span><kbd class="key-f">F</kbd></span>. </p>

<p>This FAQ aims to assist you with your self study. When it comes to learning Japanese, it is almost inevitable that you will often wonder about a lot of things. I’m not going to always be here to help you out, so I might as well dump all my knowledge here. I am sure your question will be answered in this FAQ.

<p>You don’t need one. Why? Because you can self study. Anyone can self study. It is not as hard as you think. It will actually be easier since you can go at your own pace and study with what you like such as anime. I think tutors/teachers will slow you down.</p>

<p>You can start to use Anki whenever you want actually, you can even learn the kana with it. However I recommend you start using Anki when you already have a grasp of the kana and basic grammar, after that you can download and start working on the Tango Anki decks. (Mining comes after)</p>

<p>No more than 1 hour per day. Prioritise immersion time, not flashcards. They are only a supplement to your immersion. I spend about 25 minutes with Anki. <del>And I study about 500 cards per day</del>, Not anymore, I reset my Anki. Your format may vary the amount of time you spend. Personally I just use AnimeCards.</p>

<p>You don’t know Japanese so you wouldn’t know if he’s good or not. He might as well be saying BS and due to your lack of Japanese knowledge you just take it as “wow he’s a genius”, “wow u know so much”. This is known as the fluency illusion.</p>

<p>The 常用 (Jouyou, kanji required to be taught in the Japanese school curriculum) kanji list has 2136 kanji. But don’t let this fool you. Approximately 3000 kanji are used in Japanese, outside of newspapers and JLPT/learner oriented material. Don’t worry too much about how much kanji are used in Japanese. I literally only think about how much kanji are used when I write guides and FAQs such as this one, it’s pretty irrelevant. You should just read.</p>

<p>KanjiTomo. Just hover your mouse over the word. Works 90% of the time. If not then just write the word in Google Translate, there’s a handwriting feature for Japanese.

<p>Cool. 
it depends on the j-drama though, if it is unrealistic fiction (e.g. Ikebukuro West Gate Park) then it will be as unnatural as anime, if it's realistic fiction (e.g. Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu) then it will be pretty close to real life Japanese.</p>

<p>I don’t. That’s just what you’re thinking. 
The method I talk about is just more effective than more widely spread methods. Please prove me wrong. I won’t change my argument until you can convince me otherwise. 
I believe most widespread methods don’t help people achieve, nor give proper pointers on how to achieve the one thing everyone wants to achieve: fluency. How many people have said, “I want to watch anime without subtitles xD”? Countless amounts of people. Regular textbook and early output based methods do not help learners watch anime without subtitles no matter how many years they study. The method I talk about does. You learn with anime. You learn with what made you want to learn in the first place. That’s why I say it’s the “best method”.</p>

<p>Go learn with immersion. 
Please note that the usages of these are not consistent. So I can’t really say for sure. Hiragana is used for words not written in kanji (such as こと which also has a kanji form 事), whatever sticks out at the end of a verb (e.g. 味わう, 掛ける. 怯む), things like “だろう, でしょう”, particles (such as を、の、は、に、が、で etc.), someone's name (like ゆみ, this can also be in kanji too because like I said it’s not consistent). Katakana is mainly used for foreign/imported words such as コミュニケーション (communication from English), レントゲン (Röntgen from German), オブラート (oblaat from Dutch). But katakana is used in 擬音語 (<em>giongo</em>, onomatopoeic word). There are a lot of these in Japanese. But not all giongo are written in katakana, things like あっさり are almost always in hiragana, things like ゴワゴワ are more likely to be in katakana. A change in nuance perhaps? Katakana can also be used for foreign names. Kanji is used when it is used. Yes. Kanji is used when it’s used. I recommend you just learn the usages through immersion. I have a picture in <a href="/guide">the guide</a> about these writing systems too by the way.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-wanikani-bad">Why is WaniKani bad?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-wanikani-bad" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It forces you to go in a specific order and at a specific pace. The SRS is poor and offers no customisation. You don’t learn with compelling content, instead you learn with whatever watered-down JSL stuff they throw in front of you. And it’s paid. Why would you pay to learn Japanese? It isn't a paid endeavour. I haven’t spent a penny on Japanese.  It's a glorified textbook. They put you through an RTK-style tedious 2000 kanji learning process, only that they add readings to it, I guess the people over at Tofugu didn't realise learning readings in isolation is pretty much useless.  </p>
<p>Learning is simple as it is. Don’t fall for pretty-UI learning programs such as WaniKani, they just want your money when in fact they are just selling a low quality product.  </p>

<p>Around 30k. You may think, but uh with 2k I can understand 80%? Yeah but it gets very steep after that. 10k is around 98%, 20k is around 99% and 30k is like 99.9% because I can’t guarantee that you can understand 100% with 30k.

Stop consuming content in English. Or if you really don’t have any time and it isn’t just you saying “I’d rather spend my time doing other things.” then just try to squeeze in even the smallest amount of Japanese into your day, it won’t be much but “barely any Japanese” is better than “no Japanese”</p>

<p>Uhh this sentence in the TanGo N5 AnKi Deck says Blah Blah BlaBla but this word means BlahBlaBlah Blah so wouldn’t it mean BlaBlah Blah Blahh???? WHAT???? No. I know exactly what’s happening to you. You’re taking Tango’s translation as literal. Tango’s translations are not literal, you don’t even need the translation, they do nothing but confuse you into thinking BlahBlah Bla hhBlah means BlahhBlahhBlaBla!!? Maybe you did Tango N5 before you followed a grammar guide? Maybe Tango N5 sucks? I don’t know. Here’s my advice to you→ 1. Follow a grammar guide (Cure Dolly, Tae Kim) - I’m not sure what drugs Nukemarine is on but I don’t know why he thinks the Tango decks are a suitable replacement for a grammar guide. 2. The translations are not literal, they are pretty bad from a learning perspective, I have no idea why such a decision was made. It is best if you use no translation or a literal translation at best. You’re not learning English, also who says “The class is from 7 am” in real life??  </p>

<p>It depends on your comprehension I guess. If you’re below 40%, just listen out for what words you can pickout, try to guess the meaning of phrases, try to like, listen to the sounds. When you’re at like 80% comprehension, pay attention to the plot of the anime and try to just get the meaning of sentences but not necessarily how it was said specifically e.g. what form a verb was in. For example if you came across the sentence 俺を誰だと思っている, you would know the message the sentence is trying to send but you wouldn’t pay attention to the particle を being used because you don’t need to to understand the overall meaning of the sentence. When you get about 90%+ comprehension, pay attention to the form; how the sentence is expressed, before you may not have payed attention to the には in あなたには関係ありません but now you should. Also pay attention to what specific words are used to express specific ideas in specific situations.</p>

Genki is also not meant to be used for self study, it needs at least 2 people and 1 Japanese teacher in the room. You need someone who knows what they’re doing (e.g. a Japanese teacher) in the room because if you just do it alone you will be heavily misguided. Ridiculous. I also think Genki explains things poorly, they basically teach English but force Japanese into it.</p>

<p>I absolutely hate it when people say “I can’t read kanji”. People that say this have no idea what they’re talking about. You mean, “words”; you can’t “read the words”? If you mean that then just look up the words then. If you can’t read this sentence “爆発が起こった刹那”, then DON’T say, “I can’t read the kanji”, say “I can’t read the words”. If you can’t “read kanji” then learn how to; by learning how to read. That’s just it, just learn how to read.</p>

<p>No. I know what you’re talking about. Your site uses a jank JLPT grammar list. Do not follow JLPT grammar lists. They will do nothing but confuse you. There is a reason why I only list 2 grammar guides (Tae Kim, Cure Dolly). JLPT Grammar is literally just words. Not grammar, but words. Like 90% of it is just words. You can learn all that "grammar" from anime. AVOID: japanesetest4you, wasabijpn, jlptsensei, bunpro and other similar sites.</p>

<p>Before you do this, try to think if learning how to write Japanese is even useful or not. For most people, not so much, but if you want to live in Japan you will probably need to depend on writing Japanese. To others it may just be a passion learning how to write kanji. In this day and age you can just type Japanese on a computer or on your phone, so it is not essential.
Now to learn how to write: Just write a lot. Make sure you have a good setup. Here’s what I recommend: Genkouyoushi Paper (you can also use notebooks that have Genkouyoushi Paper) and Sarasa Clip pen. Just practice writing while looking at the stroke order for characters. Repetition. There’s no hack to get around it. You may have thought, “RTK”, but you are still doing repetition with RTK.</p>

<p>I think you need to up your active immersion. Make sure you are grading your Anki cards correctly. Make sure you are ACTIVELY immersing, not passive, ACTIVE immersion. Maybe you should go over Cure Dolly/Tae Kim again. If it’s been a few months learning then learn how to read manga, I think all of this will really help you. If you feel demotivated try to watch the first thing you immersed with, so you can see how much more you can understand now versus when you first watched it. Look at your Anki stats, so you can see how much you have actually learned.  </p>

<p>That’s cause you haven’t listened and read enough. Try looking up words you hear clearly enough.

<p>Like legit reading manga and books? You can start reading Japanese after some listening immersion. How much? Let’s just say, 6 hours everyday for a month. Around 180 hours? Around 40 12 episode anime? Or maybe even less?

<p>Hey look, I’m not even gonna go into this because I think if you just do what I do, you won’t worry about things like this. Here’s what I do. The only things I mine are from anime I have already seen, or from books I’ve already read. The point is that if you’re looking up, you will remember about maybe half of what you looked up, I can’t say for sure though. So you go back to the content you just watched/read and mine whatever you didn’t remember.

<p>Wait, wait, wait. Stop right there. Get everything you know about kanji out of your head because it’s probably horribly misguided. Done? Good. Forget Kun and On and just read. I’ve never worried about these On’s and Kun’s in my entire life. It’s ridiculous and almost sad seeing people struggle because they have such a terrible misunderstanding of it. Learn words, then you will know all these On’s and Kun’s. Just read and remember words how they are, for example in this sentence: “造化の巧み”, look up the words and remember them. Screw On and Kun why is there even the distinction, it just confuses you. Yes I know in the sentence the first word is “onyomi” and the second is “kunyomi” but who cares? The problem is people get into such a conundrum over "kun vs on" due to poor explanation and communication from classes, textbooks and Japanese learning courses. It is honestly very sad.

<p>It largely depends on how many words in the sentence you don’t know. If it has 2 words you don’t know, you can choose to look up one of the words. If it has 1 word you don’t know, definitely look it up. - This is a “low hanging fruit”. If any more than 2 words, don’t look up if you want to guarantee you remember them.</p>

<p>I think, when you’re at the stage where you can go on to reading without messing up your accent, you should read more than you listen. Why is this? Well, reading is probably the best way I currently know of to increase your vocabulary. These new vocabulary you acquired can easily transfer to your listening. Most of my vocabulary is what I learned from reading. There’s about a 90% chance you will hear these new words in the next anime you watch. It happens every time. Learned 滑稽 from reading one day, heard it in the anime I watched the next. I cannot think of any exception. Reading is a powerful tool. But don’t slack on the listening! That’s still very important.
But, I can admit that reading for long hours is harder than listening for long hours so even if your reading hours are a little shorter than your listening hours (e.g. 4 listening hours 2.5 reading hours), you are still making some serious gains. Don’t see this as an excuse to slack reading though.</p>

You are halfway through your second Genki textbook or whatever. You paid for Memrise Premium. You have a WaniKani subscription. LingoDeer lured you into buying their premium too. What should you do? Screw them. Cancel your premium subscriptions. Learning Japanese is completely FREE and I can guarantee you that. Delete your old stupid decks. You may worry that you may forget everything you’ve learned, but you won’t. You won’t forget everything. Stop using the textbook, return it or something. You may also have HelloTalk friends. Well let me tell you the truth about HelloTalk friends: they don't even care about you. They just want to practice English with you, not Japanese. If you ask them to correct you they will probably block you, so they’re just stopping any chance of you ever improving. So forget about them, why even bother? Speaking practice doesn't really mean much without immersion anyway.
Now, it may be different what you gotta do depending on how good you are. If you haven’t gotten that far (e.g. can’t understand like 50% of anime yet) then just follow the <a href="/guide">New Japanese Guide</a>  from the beginning, if you already know kana, you don’t need to re-learn them. Watch the Cure Dolly grammar guide. Setup Anki, import the Tango N4+N5/Core3k decks and work through them. Immerse everyday. 
If you’re a so-called “intermediate” then just get to mining with AnimeCards straight away. Immerse everyday. 
There is no way you got to an “advanced” level or even close using a bad method so I’ll end this here.</p>

<p>The answer is simple. You already know you should learn words in context and in sentences. The context+sentence is almost always enough for you to get which definition fits. If not, try a monolingual dictionary. I came across けんかを吹っ掛ける, 吹っ掛ける has 3 definitions listed in the Daijirin. The second one had the same example けんかを— so I was able to figure it out. （２）相手の困るようなことをしかける。「けんかを―・ける」「議論を―・ける」. If you can’t figure it out then just learn whatever.
If you come across a usage of a word different to the one you learned, you don’t need to make a card for it, it will be easy to just learn this new usage.</p>

<p>If it has furigana on top, learn it with that reading. If it’s from anime, learn it with the reading they pronounce it with. If there is no furigana and audio then try using <a href="https://furigana.info/">https://furigana.info/</a>, search for the word and it will show you the readings in order of commonness. If you can’t find out, then just learn whatever.
If you come across a kana usage different to the one you learned, you don’t need to make a card for it, it will be easy to just learn this new usage.</p>

<p><em>Word count is words that have appeared in the entire history of these JLPT tests, words that appear in N5 may not appear in N4, for example. Words from N3 may also appear in N2 for example.</em>
Lower Beginner - N5 (657 words), N4 (632 words)
Beginner - N3 (1798 words)
Upper Beginner - N2 (1803 words)
Lower Intermediate - N1 (3442 words)
<em>Ok,  maybe I'm being a little harsh, but at the same time I think I'm being totally reasonable</em>
So how many <em>unique</em> words in total? 7702. So yeah, you need 7702 words to pass the JLPT N1. That was much less than I thought it would be. You can cry all you want over me saying N1 is lower intermediate, but once you reach this level like I did, you will realise that it is only the BEGINNING. 
Please note that common words found in Japanese are not in JLPT lists, so if you have 8000 AnimeCards<img alt="™" class="twemoji" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/2122.svg" title=":tm:" /> lol  you may not know all of the 7702 JLPT words.</p>

<p>No. As long as you are immersing everyday, don't worry about it! 
Is it bad? It depends how you see it. If you care what Japanese people may think, then it is not bad at all. Japanese people are very nice and kind and don't really care if you can't speak Japanese good. If you want your Japanese to be natural and "good", then you still don't need to worry about making mistakes, because making mistakes is not a problem as long as you are immersing everyday.</p>

<p>It depends. If you can’t understand like 90% of your immersion yet then it won't get you gains. If you understand over 90% then you can make gains when you listen in on it every now and then, but much less efficient than active immersion overall.
Edit: After talking with Matt vs. Japan, we settled that passive immersion is useful for getting used to spending time with your target language.</p>

<p>They have the same English meaning. English is not the best language to express Japanese. Japanese is the best language to express Japanese. You need to use a J-J dictionary such as the 大辞林 to find out the difference. If you’re not good enough to read a J-J definition yet then don’t worry about it because you can also find out the difference through immersion.</p>

<p>Ah, this one is a classic. You just need to remember the gist of the definition. It is hard at first but you get better at it. If I put this in my SRS: <code>きょうかつ [0]【恐喝】 ―する 相手の弱みなどにつけ込んでおどしつけ、お金や品物を出させようとすること。 「―罪[4]」</code> the gist I remember would be  <code>弱い相手 おどしつける お金など 出させる</code>, or something along those lines. If I put this in my SRS: <code>そう-だつ サウ― [0] 【争奪】 （名）スル 自分のものにしようとして奪い合い争うこと。「天皇杯の―戦」</code> the gist I remember would be <code>自分のものにする 奪い合い</code>, that would be enough to get the word. 
You’re probably confused but trust me it is tricky at the beginning but overtime you get good at it. 
If you’re doing sentence cards then I’ll talk you through the review process.
Let's think back to bilingual cards, how do you grade them? You should already know that the sentence that goes on the front is the thing you need to understand, and the on the back is the word along with its reading and definition is needed to understand the sentence. 
The process of reviewing sentence cards goes as follows: You read the sentence, reveal the backside of the card, read the definition that is on the back of the card, if the definition on the back made you understand the sentence better, then grade it as a Fail. If not, grade it as a Pass. In other words, you grade the card as a Pass if the extra information (the definition) on the card was not needed to comprehend the sentence. It’s basically the same for monolingual cards.</p>

<p>Uh, there is no doubt that your progress will be inevitably slower than someone that does the exact same as you but uses Anki. I don’t think any amount of reading can circumvent using the SRS. If you hate using Anki, then try to use a different format. AnimeCards are quick and simple to make and review. I recommend them. 
I think you can still get very good without using Anki but think of it like this: the SRS shaves a good year off the amount of time it takes to get fluent ;)
Of course, SRS doesn’t make you fluent, immersion does, but SRS is a supplement to your immersion. SRS makes your immersion more comprehensible, so you make the most gains.</p>

<p>Don’t use Minna no nihongo lmao. If you’re asking this question you probably have a misunderstanding on how you learn grammar as a beginner. Your goal isn’t to <em>learn</em> grammar. Your goal is to <em>acquire</em> grammar. There is a limit to how much you can understand Japanese grammar even when it is explained to you when you haven’t acquired it yet. If I read Tae Kim I can see it in completely different eyes to what a beginner sees it in. Reading a guide written in English won’t have much of a difference than reading a guide written in (watered down) Japanese, because you’re a beginner. So you just need to read Tae Kim/watch Cure Dolly and then immerse to acquire grammar. I studied Japanese grammar <em>after</em> I acquired it, not before. And I used resources for natives such as 国語辞典’s. It’s just to give myself a metaunderstanding of the grammar I have already naturally acquired. I can do this with English too, but I don’t care enough to find out so.. Eh.</p>

<p>(Intermediate= &gt;N1)
The Intermediate Blues. The Intermediate Plateau. Whatever you want to call it. This is the feeling of not feeling like you are improving, despite doing 40 Anki cards per day, speeding through your reviews, reading for 3 hours, listening for 6 hours. In fact, there is no plateau. It doesn’t exist. You are either improving (when u immerse) or getting worse (when u dont immerse). The Intermediate Blues are usually felt when you remember back when you were a beginner and you could feel your progress everyday, you don’t really get that same feeling as an intermediate learner. 
You are improving.
Please note that you can understand like 80% of your immersion with like 2000 words. You can understand like 90% with 10,000. It just gets very steep. 20,000 you understand like 95%. 30,000 you may finally be close to the 100%. The feeling sucks, but you gotta keep going.
What usually motivates is when I hear in an anime a word I learned the day before, it always gives me a motivation boost no matter what <img alt="😉" class="twemoji" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest/svg/1f609.svg" title=":wink:" /></p>
