However, this is in fact, false. First, let's consider just exactly why this argument exists in the first place. Usually when people say this, they don't know why the argument exists anyway, in other words, most people saying this don't know what they're talking about. The argument comes from the fact that if you learn Japanese using anime, you will think, \"\u304a\u3044\u3001\u3066\u3081\u3047\u306a\u306b\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff01\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\" and \"\u3061\u3063\u3001\u30aa\u30e9\u3041\u4e00\u756a\u5f37\u3047\u3093\u3060\u305c\", \"\u30b3\u30e9\u30a1\uff01\u4f55\u30d6\u30c4\u30d6\u30c4\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u3093\u3060\uff1f\u6253\u3063\u6bba\u3059\u305e\uff01\" is natural. (Just imagine some very cringe and rude things if you cant read it haha) In actual fact, this is not true at all. It is important to remember that every anime is different, some speak more natural than others, some may sound more masculine than others, some may sound more feminine than others. For example, \"Kimi no Na wa.\" is more natural than \"Dragon Ball Z\". And \"Love Live!\" is more natural than \"Kill la Kill\". In anime such as \"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Ren'ai Zunousen\", each character speaks different. Some characters speak like an \"anime\", while others actually sound pretty natural. Second, please take time to think: \"What is \"real\" Japanese?\" \"Real\" Japanese \u00b6 Anime is often argued to be not \"real\" Japanese. People arguing this only say this because it is different from the artificial, watered-down mess they learn in the textbooks. In fact, textbook Japanese is very unnatural, and can be argued that it is not \"real\" Japanese. There's many forms of Japanese. Just like how there are many forms of English. Do you speak in the same exact way as someone else you know? Probably not. But does this mean they are wrong and their English is not \"real\"? Absolutely not. Each person is unique to their own idiolects, different places have their own dialects, and so on. There are billions of different kinds of Japanese, so much so that it is not possible to point to a single form of Japanese and say that that one is the \"real\" Japanese. Anime in fact, is actually sometimes pretty natural, when I have conversations with Japanese friends what they say is close to what I've heard in anime before. Meanwhile, I have yet to experience Japanese people speaking sentences from textbooks. IN FACT... in Terrace House (the reality show with natural unscripted Japanese) they were making fun of textbook Japanese! So what exactly is real Japanese? \u00b6 Simple Answer. Japanese made by a NATIVE FOR NATIVES. Anime is scripted by natives. Movies are scripted by natives. J-Drama is scripted by natives. These content are made for Japanese people, and aren't necessarily intended for learning but surprisingly they are an incredibly powerful tool for learning. Textbooks, although they may be written by a native, they are made for foreigners. The Japanese gets watered down, artificial and filtered, for foreigners. That's why you shouldn't use content dumbed down for learners unless you are starting Japanese from scratch, in that case it is okay, but you should let go of it as soon as possible. Do not generalize Anime! \u00b6 It is annoying to constantly hear people saying that anime will make you always sound like you're about to kill someone, as demonstrated earlier. This is just people picking examples of anime that fit their argument, and completely disregarding the plethora of natural-talking anime that exist. Older anime sometimes have unusual, outdated slang, take for example, \"\u30c0\u30c1\" slang for a friend is pretty outdated by today and would sound funny if you said it to a Japanese person. Anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e yakuwarigo (role language), where the use of language is changed to fit how the character is like. For example, the anime villain may say \u8cb4\u69d8 kisama , or \u3066\u3081\u3047 a lot of the time, but anyone with a brain would know they shouldn't talk like that guy, so you won't end up saying it to a Japanese person. Because anime makes use of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e, you will get a broad sense of immersion which means you would know what sounds masculine, what sounds feminine, arrogant, polite, sarcastic etc. Which makes it a very valuable immersion resource. Not every anime character sounds like Gokuu or Naruto or some other shounen MC, like I said, every anime is different, \"Kimi no Na wa.\" actually sounds pretty natural. Why you should learn from anime \u00b6 Widely available. There is a big community effort to make just about every anime available for free even on public trackers like Nyaa.si. No one is new to anime. You're learning Japanese, chances are anime was your motivation to start learning. Why not learn from the very thing that wanted to make you start learning the language? A wide sense of \u5f79\u5272\u8a9e. This is essential. Close to real life speech, depending on what anime you watch. (e.g. Shinkai Makoto movies) Way better than boring textbooks, in terms of the actual Japanese and how much fun you're having too. PS: Your anime needs to have either Japanese subtitles or in entirely raw. People on Reddit may argue that people have watched anime for so long with English subtitles but still don't know Japanese, they're right. However, we don't use English subtitles, we watch raw or with Japanese subtitles at least.

This is probably the most complete Japanese FAQ you can find anywhere. Due to the FAQ becoming ridiculously long, it can be hard to quickly find what you want. In that case, use the search bar or Ctrl + F . Why this FAQ was made \u00b6 This FAQ aims to assist you with your self study. When it comes to learning Japanese, it is almost inevitable that you will often wonder about a lot of things. I\u2019m not going to always be here to help you out, so I might as well dump all my knowledge here. I am sure your question will be answered in this FAQ. If not, ask it in the Discord Server How do I learn Japanese? \u00b6 Through massive amounts of input , in other words immersion. See the guide for more info. Can you teach me Japanese? \u00b6 No. I can\u2019t teach you Japanese. No one can. You need to learn it yourself. Read my guide to get started. Where can I find a Japanese language tutor? \u00b6 You don\u2019t need one. Why? Because you can self study. Anyone can self study. It is not as hard as you think. It will actually be easier since you can go at your own pace and study with what you like such as anime. I think tutors/teachers will slow you down. When will I be fluent? \u00b6 It heavily depends on your method ( how you are learning Japanese) and how long you spend learning Japanese per day. You say listen and read, but what should I listen to and read? \u00b6 Raw anime, untranslated manga, light novels and visual novels. Unsubbed J-drama, Unsubbed Japanese Movies. In other words\u2026 NATIVE CONTENT: CONTENT MADE BY NATIVES, FOR NATIVES Hey shoui, so I know the method you describe is better than what I\u2019m doing right now but can you please give me permission to carry on doing my own method? \u00b6 Don\u2019t care. It\u2019s your Japanese, not mine. Best anki settings??? \u00b6 I don\u2019t know. But I use Mary's with 10 cards per day. [Link] When should I start using Anki? \u00b6 You can start to use Anki whenever you want actually, you can even learn the kana with it. However I recommend you start using Anki when you already have a grasp of the kana and basic grammar, after that you can download and start working on the Tango Anki decks. (Mining comes after) When (what time of day) should I do Anki? \u00b6 I recommend doing Anki the first thing in the morning. (As early as possible) How long should I spend on Anki? \u00b6 No more than 1 hour per day. Prioritise immersion time, not flashcards. They are only a supplement to your immersion. I spend about 25 minutes with Anki. And I study about 500 cards per day , Not anymore, I reset my Anki. Your format may vary the amount of time you spend. Personally I just use AnimeCards. About grammar, should I do Tae Kim or Cure Dolly? Pls answer \u00b6 Who cares. Just do whatever. (Cure Dolly is better in my humble opinion ;)) What JLPT are you shoui \u00b6 The JLPT is a dumb test and it should never be used to measure Japanese ability. To answer your question: better than you. My JLPT N2 friend told me.... Blah blah blah blah \u00b6 Try to be more vigilant when it comes to taking advice from people. N2 is a pretty poor level. My JLPT N2 friend studied with a lot of textbooks and he is good! \u00b6 You don\u2019t know Japanese so you wouldn\u2019t know if he\u2019s good or not. He might as well be saying BS and due to your lack of Japanese knowledge you just take it as \u201cwow he\u2019s a genius\u201d, \u201cwow u know so much\u201d. This is known as the fluency illusion. Easiest anime/manga/light novel/visual novel? \u00b6 Mitsuboshi Colors/Yotsubato!/GJ bu/Hanahira this may be inaccurate, but usually what the average DJT'er will consoom. How to study kanji? \u00b6 By reading. Just read, look up words. If you can read the words in their kanji in this sentence: \u305d\u3057\u3066\u8d77\u6b7b\u56de\u751f\u306e\u9583\u304d\u3092\u5f97\u305f\u306e\u306f\u552f\u6211\u90e8\u9577\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3002then you \u201cknow\u201d the kanji. If you look up the words and then remember them then you'll know more kanji, well done. How much kanji are used in Japanese? \u00b6 The \u5e38\u7528 (Jouyou, kanji required to be taught in the Japanese school curriculum) kanji list has 2136 kanji. But don\u2019t let this fool you. Approximately 3000 kanji are used in Japanese, outside of newspapers and JLPT/learner oriented material. Don\u2019t worry too much about how much kanji are used in Japanese. I literally only think about how much kanji are used when I write guides and FAQs such as this one, it\u2019s pretty irrelevant. You should just read. How do I look up words easier on webpages? \u00b6 Yomichan. You can find it on the Chrome Web Store or whatever Firefox uses. Load dictionaries into it and hover over text while holding the Shift key. I went into more detail in Yomichan Guide , so check that out. How do I look up words easier in manga? \u00b6 KanjiTomo. Just hover your mouse over the word. Works 90% of the time. If not then just write the word in Google Translate, there\u2019s a handwriting feature for Japanese. It will recognise what you wrote no matter how sloppy you wrote it, it\u2019s honestly great. - the detection, not the translation! After that look up the word in a dictionary. How do I look up words? \u00b6 By using a dictionary. Use https://jisho.org/ , https://eow.alc.co.jp/ and https://ejje.weblio.jp/ . Do not use Google Translate. If you\u2019re German, then use the Wadoku. If you want to use monolingual dictionaries, then just use this site https://sakura-paris.org/dict/ How to learn Japanese slang monolingually? Most J-J dictionaries don\u2019t have slang \u00b6 Use Kotobank: https://kotobank.jp/ This is a pretty good dictionary, you can access updated versions of the Daijsen, Daijirin and Seisenban. Is it useful learning kanji radicals? \u00b6 You don\u2019t need them but if kanji still look like scribbles to you after months of reading, then you might want to search \u201cKangXi Radicals\u201d on Google and just look at them, hopefully that will help. I have extreme difficulty remembering a certain word/kanji (outside of SRS) \u00b6 Read more. Listen more. You don\u2019t need to believe me if you don\u2019t want to but you will eventually remember it with more immersion. I kept on forgetting \u8778\u725b[\u304b\u305f\u3064\u3080\u308a] no matter how much times I looked it up, or so I thought. After about my 80th look-up I was able to remember it. So yeah. Or you could make an Anki card for it\u2026 I am trying to learn grammar but I keep on forgetting the grammar points and I don\u2019t understand the grammar points. \u00b6 Try to rethink your approach to grammar. You need to immerse while following a grammar guide. Recommended grammar guides are Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. You can find these in Resources . Listen more. Read more. Is remembering the kanji form of words usually written in kana useful? For example \u849f\u84bb is the kanji form of \u30b3\u30f3\u30cb\u30e3\u30af \u00b6 Yes. Best dictionary for first-time monolingual users? \u00b6 There is no single dictionary I can point to and say it's the best. Every dictionary has their weak points and strong points. Use every dictionary together. If you\u2019re interested in my order of dictionaries in Yomichan, you can find that at Monolingual Guide I don\u2019t understand this sentence even though I know all the words. \u00b6 Just forget about it for now. Listen more. Read more. It will come to you soon. When I\u2019m listening I don\u2019t understand but when I looked at the subtitles/transcript I actually knew the words, why is this? \u00b6 You need to listen more. Stop using subtitles. When I\u2019m reading I don\u2019t understand, and I even looked up the words\u2026 \u00b6 Read more. Increase reading speed??? \u00b6 Read more. Can I use Japanese music to learn Japanese? \u00b6 By just listening to it? No. What you can do is look at the lyric sheet and look up the words. But they don\u2019t speak like real life in anime though? \u00b6 anime japanese I am going to immerse with J-drama instead because they don\u2019t talk real life in anime. \u00b6 Cool. it depends on the j-drama though, if it is unrealistic fiction (e.g. Ikebukuro West Gate Park) then it will be as unnatural as anime, if it's realistic fiction (e.g. Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu) then it will be pretty close to real life Japanese. I want to be able to understand anime without subtitles, will your guide work? \u00b6 Yes. I want to be able to speak with natives naturally, will your guide work? \u00b6 Yes. Will reading the AJATT, MIA and AntiMoon site be useful? \u00b6 Kinda. 80% of the stuff on AJATT is trash, a lot of what's on MIA is about its Anki addons, but there are some helpful things on there. And honestly I don't even know about AntiMoon. The Must Read category in this server is enough for most people. How long should I immerse per day? \u00b6 As much as you can. The more Japanese you do, the more gains you get. This method seems too hardcore for me\u2026 \u00b6 That\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t need to do it if you don\u2019t want to. It's your loss though... Why do you make it seem like your method is the only way to learn Japanese? \u00b6 I don\u2019t. That\u2019s just what you\u2019re thinking. The method I talk about is just more effective than more widely spread methods. Please prove me wrong. I won\u2019t change my argument until you can convince me otherwise. I believe most widespread methods don\u2019t help people achieve, nor give proper pointers on how to achieve the one thing everyone wants to achieve: fluency. How many people have said, \u201cI want to watch anime without subtitles xD\u201d? Countless amounts of people. Regular textbook and early output based methods do not help learners watch anime without subtitles no matter how many years they study. The method I talk about does. You learn with anime. You learn with what made you want to learn in the first place. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s the \u201cbest method\u201d. shoui what\u2019s your immersion setup? \u00b6 Laptop and video player When is hiragana, katakana and kanji used? \u00b6 Go learn with immersion. Please note that the usages of these are not consistent. So I can\u2019t really say for sure. Hiragana is used for words not written in kanji (such as \u3053\u3068 which also has a kanji form \u4e8b), whatever sticks out at the end of a verb (e.g. \u5473\u308f\u3046, \u639b\u3051\u308b. \u602f\u3080), things like \u201c\u3060\u308d\u3046, \u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u201d, particles (such as \u3092\u3001\u306e\u3001\u306f\u3001\u306b\u3001\u304c\u3001\u3067 etc.), someone's name (like \u3086\u307f, this can also be in kanji too because like I said it\u2019s not consistent). Katakana is mainly used for foreign/imported words such as \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 (communication from English), \u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30b2\u30f3 (R\u00f6ntgen from German), \u30aa\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc\u30c8 (oblaat from Dutch). But katakana is used in \u64ec\u97f3\u8a9e ( giongo , onomatopoeic word). There are a lot of these in Japanese. But not all giongo are written in katakana, things like \u3042\u3063\u3055\u308a are almost always in hiragana, things like \u30b4\u30ef\u30b4\u30ef are more likely to be in katakana. A change in nuance perhaps? Katakana can also be used for foreign names. Kanji is used when it is used. Yes. Kanji is used when it\u2019s used. I recommend you just learn the usages through immersion. I have a picture in the guide about these writing systems too by the way. Why is WaniKani bad? \u00b6 It forces you to go in a specific order and at a specific pace. The SRS is poor and offers no customisation. You don\u2019t learn with compelling content, instead you learn with whatever watered-down JSL stuff they throw in front of you. And it\u2019s paid. Why would you pay to learn Japanese? It isn't a paid endeavour. I haven\u2019t spent a penny on Japanese. It's a glorified textbook. They put you through an RTK-style tedious 2000 kanji learning process, only that they add readings to it, I guess the people over at Tofugu didn't realise learning readings in isolation is pretty much useless. Learning is simple as it is. Don\u2019t fall for pretty-UI learning programs such as WaniKani, they just want your money when in fact they are just selling a low quality product. Fluentcards/Videobook looks bad. Please help. \u00b6 Animebook. UPDATE: You can use MPV instead How many words do I need to know to understand EVERYTHING? \u00b6 Around 30k. You may think, but uh with 2k I can understand 80%? Yeah but it gets very steep after that. 10k is around 98%, 20k is around 99% and 30k is like 99.9% because I can\u2019t guarantee that you can understand 100% with 30k. But it is definitely a good number to aim for. I don't understand everything in English so is it really worth the endeavour? That is your decision. Why are Core decks bad? Should I do Core decks? \u00b6 They aren't bad... it's just... The frequency lists the Core decks are based on are very low quality. So you aren\u2019t even learning \u201ccore\u201d words. It is also much more difficult than Tango. HUH? NO FURIGANA? THAT\u2019S IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THEN!!! \u00b6 Furigana has never been necessary and relying on it only holds you back becoming able to read fluently. You should learn how to function without it. In my opinion furigana is pretty useless apart from when it's on names. What\u2019s better Tango N5+N4 or Core2k/3k? \u00b6 Doesn\u2019t matter as long as you get onto mining straight after you completed them. I don\u2019t have that green + button like you do in Yomichan \u00b6 Setup AnkiConnect. https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/ Make sure you also have a proper card type and have filled in the fields correctly. Should I follow JLPT lists? \u00b6 No, the JLPT is very restrictive. Just learn what you come across in your immersion. Are you learning Japanese to pass an exam lmfao? I'm not ready for watching anime or anything without subtitles yet... that's for like, advanced learners like JLP\u30fc NO. \u00b6 Wrong. It\u2019s never too early to watch anime without subtitles. You need to watch anime without subtitles to get good at it anyway. Reddit \u00b6 If you wish to make actual gains in Japanese, I suggest you stop using Reddit completely. I don\u2019t have time to learn Japanese \u00b6 You may have more time than you think you do to learn Japanese. Stop playing video games. Stop going on Reddit. Wake up early. Do your Anki reps in the morning. Stop talking on Discord. Stop consuming content in English. Or if you really don\u2019t have any time and it isn\u2019t just you saying \u201cI\u2019d rather spend my time doing other things.\u201d then just try to squeeze in even the smallest amount of Japanese into your day, it won\u2019t be much but \u201cbarely any Japanese\u201d is better than \u201cno Japanese\u201d I am immersing late at night, is this bad? \u00b6 It is bad. Please don\u2019t immerse when you\u2019re supposed to be sleeping, you\u2019re only reducing your immersion quality. This sentence in the Tango N5 deck\u2026 \u00b6 Uhh this sentence in the TanGo N5 AnKi Deck says Blah Blah BlaBla but this word means BlahBlaBlah Blah so wouldn\u2019t it mean BlaBlah Blah Blahh???? WHAT???? No. I know exactly what\u2019s happening to you. You\u2019re taking Tango\u2019s translation as literal. Tango\u2019s translations are not literal, you don\u2019t even need the translation, they do nothing but confuse you into thinking BlahBlah Bla hhBlah means BlahhBlahhBlaBla!!? Maybe you did Tango N5 before you followed a grammar guide? Maybe Tango N5 sucks? I don\u2019t know. Here\u2019s my advice to you\u2192 1. Follow a grammar guide (Cure Dolly, Tae Kim) - I\u2019m not sure what drugs Nukemarine is on but I don\u2019t know why he thinks the Tango decks are a suitable replacement for a grammar guide. 2. The translations are not literal, they are pretty bad from a learning perspective, I have no idea why such a decision was made. It is best if you use no translation or a literal translation at best. You\u2019re not learning English, also who says \u201cThe class is from 7 am\u201d in real life?? UMM... I HEAR G SOUND BUT SOUND LIKE N OR GNNGNGGNGGN WHY??? \u00b6 \u9f3b\u6fc1\u97f3 I am actively immersing, you say just pay attention to what they\u2019re saying, can you go into more detail? \u00b6 It depends on your comprehension I guess. If you\u2019re below 40%, just listen out for what words you can pickout, try to guess the meaning of phrases, try to like, listen to the sounds. When you\u2019re at like 80% comprehension, pay attention to the plot of the anime and try to just get the meaning of sentences but not necessarily how it was said specifically e.g. what form a verb was in. For example if you came across the sentence \u4ffa\u3092\u8ab0\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b, you would know the message the sentence is trying to send but you wouldn\u2019t pay attention to the particle \u3092 being used because you don\u2019t need to to understand the overall meaning of the sentence. When you get about 90%+ comprehension, pay attention to the form; how the sentence is expressed, before you may not have payed attention to the \u306b\u306f in \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306b\u306f\u95a2\u4fc2\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093 but now you should. Also pay attention to what specific words are used to express specific ideas in specific situations. Will re-watching shows I have already immersed with be useful? \u00b6 Yes but once you get bored, switch! Can I get fluent with only 1 hour of immersion? \u00b6 No. It will take you 10 years to even get close. Is Genki worth it? \u00b6 In my humble opinion, no. Genki is not worth your time. Genki is inferior to the free resources I\u2019m giving you such as Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. Genki is also not meant to be used for self study, it needs at least 2 people and 1 Japanese teacher in the room. You need someone who knows what they\u2019re doing (e.g. a Japanese teacher) in the room because if you just do it alone you will be heavily misguided. Ridiculous. I also think Genki explains things poorly, they basically teach English but force Japanese into it. Should I do RTK (Remembering the Kanji)? \u00b6 If you find kanji to be scribbles after months of reading then sure. Can you tell me what this kanji is? \u00b6 Just write it in Google Translate handwriting feature, it will detect it no matter how sloppy you wrote it. Then copy it into a dictionary such as jisho.org and then you\u2019ll get your answer. I can\u2019t read kanji yet\u2026 \u00b6 I absolutely hate it when people say \u201cI can\u2019t read kanji\u201d. People that say this have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. You mean, \u201cwords\u201d; you can\u2019t \u201cread the words\u201d? If you mean that then just look up the words then. If you can\u2019t read this sentence \u201c\u7206\u767a\u304c\u8d77\u3053\u3063\u305f\u5239\u90a3\u201d, then DON\u2019T say, \u201cI can\u2019t read the kanji\u201d, say \u201cI can\u2019t read the words\u201d. If you can\u2019t \u201cread kanji\u201d then learn how to; by learning how to read. That\u2019s just it, just learn how to read. How do I learn how to read? \u00b6 By looking up the words. Look at the Japanese sentence I gave above. Chances are you don\u2019t know \u5239\u90a3. Copy it into a dictionary or use Yomichan, it will show you the reading (\u305b\u3064\u306a) and the meaning (\u304d\u308f\u3081\u3066\u77ed\u3044\u6642\u9593)(if you are learning it bilingually it might be moment; instant). Congratulations you now know how to read more Japanese. Hey shoui I found a cool site and it has so much grammar on it it\u2019s called\u2026 \u00b6 No. I know what you\u2019re talking about. Your site uses a jank JLPT grammar list. Do not follow JLPT grammar lists. They will do nothing but confuse you. There is a reason why I only list 2 grammar guides (Tae Kim, Cure Dolly). JLPT Grammar is literally just words. Not grammar, but words. Like 90% of it is just words. You can learn all that \"grammar\" from anime. AVOID: japanesetest4you, wasabijpn, jlptsensei, bunpro and other similar sites. How do you learn how to write Japanese? \u00b6 Before you do this, try to think if learning how to write Japanese is even useful or not. For most people, not so much, but if you want to live in Japan you will probably need to depend on writing Japanese. To others it may just be a passion learning how to write kanji. In this day and age you can just type Japanese on a computer or on your phone, so it is not essential. Now to learn how to write: Just write a lot. Make sure you have a good setup. Here\u2019s what I recommend: Genkouyoushi Paper (you can also use notebooks that have Genkouyoushi Paper) and Sarasa Clip pen. Just practice writing while looking at the stroke order for characters. Repetition. There\u2019s no hack to get around it. You may have thought, \u201cRTK\u201d, but you are still doing repetition with RTK. It's been a few months of learning. Why does it feel like nothing is clicking? \u00b6 I think you need to up your active immersion. Make sure you are grading your Anki cards correctly. Make sure you are ACTIVELY immersing, not passive, ACTIVE immersion. Maybe you should go over Cure Dolly/Tae Kim again. If it\u2019s been a few months learning then learn how to read manga, I think all of this will really help you. If you feel demotivated try to watch the first thing you immersed with, so you can see how much more you can understand now versus when you first watched it. Look at your Anki stats, so you can see how much you have actually learned. I don't understand anything when immersing. Why is that? How long will it take for me to understand what I'm listening to?** \u00b6 That\u2019s cause you haven\u2019t listened and read enough. Try looking up words you hear clearly enough. It will only take a few months of listening+looking up+japanese subtitles+anki to understand 80% of your immersion. That 20% is still the actual important details so you will still have a long way to go tho. Hang in there. I'm trying to translate Japanese into English while immersing. Is this wrong? \u00b6 Yes. But as a beginner it is hard to not translate to English. Try to use your willpower to try and not translate, overtime it will just go away and you will understand and think about Japanese you hear, in Japanese. How often should I study and for how long? \u00b6 Try to study everyday, so it will eventually become a habit. I don\u2019t even need to think to open up Anki, click my deck and then click \u201cStudy Now\u201d. It\u2019s all inertia to me. Try to study as long as you can. If you have free time, try to use it for Japanese. What are the requirements for reading Japanese? How long will it take for me to get there? \u00b6 Like legit reading manga and books? You can start reading Japanese after some listening immersion. How much? Let\u2019s just say, 6 hours everyday for a month. Around 180 hours? Around 40 12 episode anime? Or maybe even less? After that you can get into reading. At what point do you begin learning how to read kanji? \u00b6 See above. What is good immersion material for beginners? \u00b6 Most anime. Pretty much every slice of life anime. But don\u2019t restrict yourself to just slice of life anime. Some things are surprisingly incredibly good for beginners such as Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer). Just find what interests you. You just need to immerse with whatever interests you because that makes it fun. I have no idea how to start making decks and memorizing kanji. What do I do? \u00b6 Making decks - Just follow the animecards.site guide. Memorizing kanji - Just do reading practice, and make cards if you wish. How does you mine, shoui? \u00b6 https://www.animecards.site How many new cards per day? \u00b6 Just do 10. If you feel like it is too less, do 15 or 20. Please bear in mind that the more new cards you do, the more reviews you\u2019ll get. Mining Mentality: When to mine (add to Anki) or just to look up and carry on? \u00b6 Hey look, I\u2019m not even gonna go into this because I think if you just do what I do, you won\u2019t worry about things like this. Here\u2019s what I do. The only things I mine are from anime I have already seen, or from books I\u2019ve already read. The point is that if you\u2019re looking up, you will remember about maybe half of what you looked up, I can\u2019t say for sure though. So you go back to the content you just watched/read and mine whatever you didn\u2019t remember. I\u2019ve been doing this for nearly 6 months and it has worked great for me, and I think it will do for you too. How many cards do you make per day? \u00b6 One anime episode worth of cards per day. I mine anime I have already watched. When I run out of new cards I mine another episode to stock up on more cards to learn. I also mine books I\u2019ve already read. I add 20 cards to review for the next day. When is Kun-yomi and On-yomi used? \u00b6 Wait, wait, wait. Stop right there. Get everything you know about kanji out of your head because it\u2019s probably horribly misguided. Done? Good. Forget Kun and On and just read. I\u2019ve never worried about these On\u2019s and Kun\u2019s in my entire life. It\u2019s ridiculous and almost sad seeing people struggle because they have such a terrible misunderstanding of it. Learn words, then you will know all these On\u2019s and Kun\u2019s. Just read and remember words how they are, for example in this sentence: \u201c\u9020\u5316\u306e\u5de7\u307f\u201d, look up the words and remember them. Screw On and Kun why is there even the distinction, it just confuses you. Yes I know in the sentence the first word is \u201conyomi\u201d and the second is \u201ckunyomi\u201d but who cares? The problem is people get into such a conundrum over \"kun vs on\" due to poor explanation and communication from classes, textbooks and Japanese learning courses. It is honestly very sad. Next question. Are mnemonics for kana, kanji and words and such good? \u00b6 No. W-what should I do when I come across a kanji I don\u2019t know? \u00b6 You mean a WORD you don\u2019t know?? Look it up. If you don\u2019t remember it then that\u2019s ok. Chances are you will see it in your immersion again, and that will be your chance to remember it What should I do when I come across a word I don\u2019t know (in reading)? \u00b6 See above. This is a better worded question than above. What should I do when I come across a word I don\u2019t know (in listening)? \u00b6 It largely depends on how many words in the sentence you don\u2019t know. If it has 2 words you don\u2019t know, you can choose to look up one of the words. If it has 1 word you don\u2019t know, definitely look it up. - This is a \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d. If any more than 2 words, don\u2019t look up if you want to guarantee you remember them. But can't I learn Japanese by focusing on the audio while using the English subs as a guide? \u00b6 No. What if I can't find anything I enjoy immersing with? \u00b6 Keep on looking. Keeeep on looking. Try a lot of anime, hey, maybe it gets more interesting in later episodes? Maybe switch to J-drama? Or Japanese YouTube? For example, I finished Bakemonogatari (the light novel) in 3 days because I was HOOKED onto it. I found it really interesting and thus I wanted to finish it. I haven\u2019t done this with any other book before. Can I use romanji? \u00b6 First of all, it\u2019s romaji not romanji. And second, no. Don\u2019t use romaji. Learn the kana as quickly as you can. Kana or Romaji input method (IME)? \u00b6 For your PC, definitely romaji input. For your phone, then kana input. No questions asked. Should I use Japanese subs? \u00b6 I might have already answered this but\u2026 not always. Only in the beginning. Split your time up between watching raw and in Japanese subs. The reason you need to watch raw is so you get the best accent in the end. How much should I balance my listening and reading? \u00b6 I think, when you\u2019re at the stage where you can go on to reading without messing up your accent, you should read more than you listen. Why is this? Well, reading is probably the best way I currently know of to increase your vocabulary. These new vocabulary you acquired can easily transfer to your listening. Most of my vocabulary is what I learned from reading. There\u2019s about a 90% chance you will hear these new words in the next anime you watch. It happens every time. Learned \u6ed1\u7a3d from reading one day, heard it in the anime I watched the next. I cannot think of any exception. Reading is a powerful tool. But don\u2019t slack on the listening! That\u2019s still very important. But, I can admit that reading for long hours is harder than listening for long hours so even if your reading hours are a little shorter than your listening hours (e.g. 4 listening hours 2.5 reading hours), you are still making some serious gains. Don\u2019t see this as an excuse to slack reading though. Should I study other languages along with Japanese? \u00b6 If you don\u2019t want to get remotely good at any of the languages, then ok. But if you want to get good at Japanese, then don\u2019t study any other languages while studying Japanese. I am learning Japanese with (n) textbook, is it bad? \u00b6 Yes. Please follow the Japanese Guide and reconsider your approach to learning. Is X textbook better than Y textbook? \u00b6 Both bad. Follow my guide. Pitch Accent? \u00b6 Learn the basics of pitch accent, either from Dogen's course or the NHK Accent Dictionary so that you can learn how to hear it in your input, so you can acquire it naturally. I don\u2019t want to believe anything you\u2019re saying and I would rather stick with what I\u2019m doing if that\u2019s okay with you? \u00b6 Ok Where to find anime for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Check out nyaa.si, anime-raws list, Crunchyroll and animelon in Resources If you have money check out Netflix. Crunchyroll is free but with ads. You can turn off subs on desktop but not on mobile. I\u2019ve heard VRV works but it\u2019s blocked in my region \\;( Where to find j-drama for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Check out nyaa.si, rakuten viki, the j-drama google drive folder in the Resources . Chinese streaming sites seem to also have a lot of Chinese sub j-dramas, so you can use them if you can\u2019t speak/read Chinese. If you have money check out Netflix and Hulu JP. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be on AvistaZ private tracker then you have access to just about any J-drama you like. If you ask me (shoui) nicely I can find something on AvistaZ for you. I won't.

Where to find light novels for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Itazuraneko. If you have money you can buy digital light novels from Amazon JP. Where to find visual novels for learning Japanese? \u00b6 (listed in Resources ) itazuraneko, nblog, ryuublogger, (sukebei)nyaa.si. If you have money you can buy visual novels from Steam. If you are lucky enough to be on AnimeBytes private tracker then you have access to just about any visual novel you like. If you ask me (shoui) nicely I can find something on AnimeBytes for you. No seriously, I will. Just make sure it isn't already on the free resources available to you. How to text-hook visual novels? \u00b6 vn guide How do I switch from traditional methods to your method? \u00b6 You probably have a stupid flashcard deck on some stupid SRS that probably isn\u2019t Anki. Even if you used Anki you were probably using some stupid pre-made deck. You are halfway through your second Genki textbook or whatever. You paid for Memrise Premium. You have a WaniKani subscription. LingoDeer lured you into buying their premium too. What should you do? Screw them. Cancel your premium subscriptions. Learning Japanese is completely FREE and I can guarantee you that. Delete your old stupid decks. You may worry that you may forget everything you\u2019ve learned, but you won\u2019t. You won\u2019t forget everything. Stop using the textbook, return it or something. You may also have HelloTalk friends. Well let me tell you the truth about HelloTalk friends: they don't even care about you. They just want to practice English with you, not Japanese. If you ask them to correct you they will probably block you, so they\u2019re just stopping any chance of you ever improving. So forget about them, why even bother? Speaking practice doesn't really mean much without immersion anyway. Now, it may be different what you gotta do depending on how good you are. If you haven\u2019t gotten that far (e.g. can\u2019t understand like 50% of anime yet) then just follow the New Japanese Guide from the beginning, if you already know kana, you don\u2019t need to re-learn them. Watch the Cure Dolly grammar guide. Setup Anki, import the Tango N4+N5/Core3k decks and work through them. Immerse everyday. If you\u2019re a so-called \u201cintermediate\u201d then just get to mining with AnimeCards straight away. Immerse everyday. There is no way you got to an \u201cadvanced\u201d level or even close using a bad method so I\u2019ll end this here. How to deal with words with multiple meanings? \u00b6 The answer is simple. You already know you should learn words in context and in sentences. The context+sentence is almost always enough for you to get which definition fits. If not, try a monolingual dictionary. I came across \u3051\u3093\u304b\u3092\u5439\u3063\u639b\u3051\u308b, \u5439\u3063\u639b\u3051\u308b has 3 definitions listed in the Daijirin. The second one had the same example \u3051\u3093\u304b\u3092\u2014 so I was able to figure it out. \uff08\uff12\uff09\u76f8\u624b\u306e\u56f0\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3057\u304b\u3051\u308b\u3002\u300c\u3051\u3093\u304b\u3092\u2015\u30fb\u3051\u308b\u300d\u300c\u8b70\u8ad6\u3092\u2015\u30fb\u3051\u308b\u300d. If you can\u2019t figure it out then just learn whatever. If you come across a usage of a word different to the one you learned, you don\u2019t need to make a card for it, it will be easy to just learn this new usage. How to deal with words with multiple readings? \u00b6 If it has furigana on top, learn it with that reading. If it\u2019s from anime, learn it with the reading they pronounce it with. If there is no furigana and audio then try using https://furigana.info/ , search for the word and it will show you the readings in order of commonness. If you can\u2019t find out, then just learn whatever. If you come across a kana usage different to the one you learned, you don\u2019t need to make a card for it, it will be easy to just learn this new usage. So the JLPT is sh/t, so what \u201clevel\u201d are each of the N\u2019s? \u00b6 Word count is words that have appeared in the entire history of these JLPT tests, words that appear in N5 may not appear in N4, for example. Words from N3 may also appear in N2 for example. Lower Beginner - N5 (657 words), N4 (632 words) Beginner - N3 (1798 words) Upper Beginner - N2 (1803 words) Lower Intermediate - N1 (3442 words) Ok, maybe I'm being a little harsh, but at the same time I think I'm being totally reasonable So how many unique words in total? 7702. So yeah, you need 7702 words to pass the JLPT N1. That was much less than I thought it would be. You can cry all you want over me saying N1 is lower intermediate, but once you reach this level like I did, you will realise that it is only the BEGINNING. Please note that common words found in Japanese are not in JLPT lists, so if you have 8000 AnimeCards lol you may not know all of the 7702 JLPT words. Is it bad if I make a mistake when speaking? \u00b6 No. As long as you are immersing everyday, don't worry about it! Is it bad? It depends how you see it. If you care what Japanese people may think, then it is not bad at all. Japanese people are very nice and kind and don't really care if you can't speak Japanese good. If you want your Japanese to be natural and \"good\", then you still don't need to worry about making mistakes, because making mistakes is not a problem as long as you are immersing everyday. I can understand my immersion but I\u2019m not fluent, what should I do? \u00b6 You need more immersion. Pay attention to what they\u2019re saying. This is literally what I struggle with by the way, but you literally just need more immersion and you\u2019ll get good, believe me \u306f vs \u304c \u00b6 They are completely different. Cure Dolly has a good explanation of this, start with her first video. The first step to understanding the difference is not associating them with each other. And then immerse to deepen your understanding Can I get by with just kana? Kanji is too hard. \u00b6 no Thoughts on immersing while sleeping? \u00b6 It's BS. Thoughts on kanji study apps? \u00b6 No. JUST READ!!!!!!!!! Will speaking a lot make me good? \u00b6 No. Then how do you get good? \u00b6 Through input. Primarily listening for learning how to speak naturally and reading for increasing your vocabulary. Speaking is not learning. Listening and reading is learning. You are not learning anything when you\u2019re not immersing. Speaking is just the icing on the cake. Should I pronounce out loud new words? \u00b6 No, I don't recommend it. You can get by just by reading it in your head. Should I read out loud the sentence in my sentence cards? \u00b6 Nah you don't need to. Absolutely fine if you just read it in your head. Thoughts on passive immersion? \u00b6 It depends. If you can\u2019t understand like 90% of your immersion yet then it won't get you gains. If you understand over 90% then you can make gains when you listen in on it every now and then, but much less efficient than active immersion overall. Edit: After talking with Matt vs. Japan, we settled that passive immersion is useful for getting used to spending time with your target language. Thoughts on Duolingo, Busuu, LingoDeer, Memrise, Drops and other similar apps \u00b6 Don\u2019t even bother LMAO. Follow my guide for some real Japanese gains Link These two words have the same meaning!! \u00b6 They have the same English meaning. English is not the best language to express Japanese. Japanese is the best language to express Japanese. You need to use a J-J dictionary such as the \u5927\u8f9e\u6797 to find out the difference. If you\u2019re not good enough to read a J-J definition yet then don\u2019t worry about it because you can also find out the difference through immersion. Grading monolingual cards \u00b6 Ah, this one is a classic. You just need to remember the gist of the definition. It is hard at first but you get better at it. If I put this in my SRS: \u304d\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3064 [0]\u3010\u6050\u559d\u3011 \u2015\u3059\u308b \u76f8\u624b\u306e\u5f31\u307f\u306a\u3069\u306b\u3064\u3051\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u304a\u3069\u3057\u3064\u3051\u3001\u304a\u91d1\u3084\u54c1\u7269\u3092\u51fa\u3055\u305b\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3002 \u300c\u2015\u7f6a[4]\u300d the gist I remember would be \u5f31\u3044\u76f8\u624b \u304a\u3069\u3057\u3064\u3051\u308b \u304a\u91d1\u306a\u3069 \u51fa\u3055\u305b\u308b , or something along those lines. If I put this in my SRS: \u305d\u3046-\u3060\u3064 \u30b5\u30a6\u2015 [0] \u3010\u4e89\u596a\u3011 \uff08\u540d\uff09\u30b9\u30eb \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u3082\u306e\u306b\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u3066\u596a\u3044\u5408\u3044\u4e89\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3002\u300c\u5929\u7687\u676f\u306e\u2015\u6226\u300d the gist I remember would be \u81ea\u5206\u306e\u3082\u306e\u306b\u3059\u308b \u596a\u3044\u5408\u3044 , that would be enough to get the word. You\u2019re probably confused but trust me it is tricky at the beginning but overtime you get good at it. If you\u2019re doing sentence cards then I\u2019ll talk you through the review process. Let's think back to bilingual cards, how do you grade them? You should already know that the sentence that goes on the front is the thing you need to understand, and the on the back is the word along with its reading and definition is needed to understand the sentence. The process of reviewing sentence cards goes as follows: You read the sentence, reveal the backside of the card, read the definition that is on the back of the card, if the definition on the back made you understand the sentence better, then grade it as a Fail. If not, grade it as a Pass. In other words, you grade the card as a Pass if the extra information (the definition) on the card was not needed to comprehend the sentence. It\u2019s basically the same for monolingual cards. How to grade Tango cards? \u00b6 You should already know that the sentence that goes on the front is the thing you need to understand, and the on the back is the word along with its reading and definition is needed to understand the sentence. The process of reviewing sentence cards goes as follows: You read the sentence, reveal the backside of the card, read the definition that is on the back of the card, if the definition on the back made you understand the sentence better, then grade it as a Fail. If not, grade it as a Pass. In other words, you grade the card as a Pass if the extra information (the definition) on the card was not needed to comprehend the sentence. Why do you do AnimeCards over sentence cards? \u00b6 Muh opinion I want to pass the JLPT N1. How long will that take me with your method? \u00b6 Like if you listen for 6 hours every single day and read for 6 hours every single day, and do 40 cards in Anki per day then like nearly a year? JLPT N1 is not that good, you know. I don\u2019t want to use Anki. Is that fine? \u00b6 Uh, there is no doubt that your progress will be inevitably slower than someone that does the exact same as you but uses Anki. I don\u2019t think any amount of reading can circumvent using the SRS. If you hate using Anki, then try to use a different format. AnimeCards are quick and simple to make and review. I recommend them. I think you can still get very good without using Anki but think of it like this: the SRS shaves a good year off the amount of time it takes to get fluent ;) Of course, SRS doesn\u2019t make you fluent, immersion does, but SRS is a supplement to your immersion. SRS makes your immersion more comprehensible, so you make the most gains. How about using an all Japanese textbook such as \u201cMinna no Nihongo\u201d? \u00b6 Don\u2019t use Minna no nihongo lmao. If you\u2019re asking this question you probably have a misunderstanding on how you learn grammar as a beginner. Your goal isn\u2019t to learn grammar. Your goal is to acquire grammar. There is a limit to how much you can understand Japanese grammar even when it is explained to you when you haven\u2019t acquired it yet. If I read Tae Kim I can see it in completely different eyes to what a beginner sees it in. Reading a guide written in English won\u2019t have much of a difference than reading a guide written in (watered down) Japanese, because you\u2019re a beginner. So you just need to read Tae Kim/watch Cure Dolly and then immerse to acquire grammar. I studied Japanese grammar after I acquired it, not before. And I used resources for natives such as \u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178\u2019s. It\u2019s just to give myself a metaunderstanding of the grammar I have already naturally acquired. I can do this with English too, but I don\u2019t care enough to find out so.. Eh. Hey shoui I found (x) Japanese course, is it good? \u00b6 If I haven\u2019t talked about it yet then probably no because I don\u2019t want to talk about silly courses like JapanesePod101, Pimsleur, Rosetta Stone, Assimil. All which have been proved to be utter ass. There is a good reason why I haven\u2019t talked about it yet. When should I put my PC/phone in Japanese? \u00b6 You don\u2019t need to but it definitely helps. Do it when you\u2019re used to reading I guess. Is (x) anime good for learning Japanese? \u00b6 Yes. I only want to sentence mine from anime, is this fine? \u00b6 Yeah. I only want to sentence mine from books, is this fine? \u00b6 Yeah. Is learning how to understand dialects like Kansai-ben difficult? \u00b6 No. The Intermediate Blues \u00b6 (Intermediate= >N1) The Intermediate Blues. The Intermediate Plateau. Whatever you want to call it. This is the feeling of not feeling like you are improving, despite doing 40 Anki cards per day, speeding through your reviews, reading for 3 hours, listening for 6 hours. In fact, there is no plateau. It doesn\u2019t exist. You are either improving (when u immerse) or getting worse (when u dont immerse). The Intermediate Blues are usually felt when you remember back when you were a beginner and you could feel your progress everyday, you don\u2019t really get that same feeling as an intermediate learner. You are improving. Please note that you can understand like 80% of your immersion with like 2000 words. You can understand like 90% with 10,000. It just gets very steep. 20,000 you understand like 95%. 30,000 you may finally be close to the 100%. The feeling sucks, but you gotta keep going. What usually motivates is when I hear in an anime a word I learned the day before, it always gives me a motivation boost no matter what Should I put Japanese names into Anki? \u00b6 Yeah whatever, do it if you want to learn how to read Japanese names like in anime credits or something, otherwise I don\u2019t see the point. It\u2019s still a pretty neat skill to have though. \u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b\u259c\u259b You have reached the end of the FAQ!

Katakana is mainly used for foreign/imported words such as \u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 (communication from English), \u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30b2\u30f3 (R\u00f6ntgen from German), \u30aa\u30d6\u30e9\u30fc\u30c8 (oblaat from Dutch). But katakana is used in \u64ec\u97f3\u8a9e ( giongo , onomatopoeic word). There are a lot of these in Japanese. But not all giongo are written in katakana, things like \u3042\u3063\u3055\u308a are almost always in hiragana, things like \u30b4\u30ef\u30b4\u30ef are more likely to be in katakana. A change in nuance perhaps? Katakana can also be used for foreign names. Kanji is used when it is used. Yes. Kanji is used when it\u2019s used. I recommend you just learn the usages through immersion. I have a picture in the guide about these writing systems too by the way.","title":"When is hiragana, katakana and kanji used?"},{"location":"faq/#why-is-wanikani-bad","text":"It forces you to go in a specific order and at a specific pace.

Let's think back to bilingual cards, how do you grade them? You should already know that the sentence that goes on the front is the thing you need to understand, and the on the back is the word along with its reading and definition is needed to understand the sentence. The process of reviewing sentence cards goes as follows: You read the sentence, reveal the backside of the card, read the definition that is on the back of the card, if the definition on the back made you understand the sentence better, then grade it as a Fail. If not, grade it as a Pass. In other words, you grade the card as a Pass if the extra information (the definition) on the card was not needed to comprehend the sentence.

But language learning is something you do in the long term, so please take time to read this guide in its entirety. I apologise if this guide may get a little scientific, and I will not write a simplified version of this guide. Everything stated below is what you need to know. Sorry about that. Why many people \u201cfail\u201d to learn Japanese \u00b6 Before I talk about this, I would like to clarify what I mean by \u201cfail\u201d. What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many people love the idea of being fluent, and being able to watch Japanese media without subtitles, in their raw form. However, many people also don\u2019t ever reach this goal, or even get close. I believe it mostly isn\u2019t their fault, but rather, the method \u2019s fault. Whether you\u2019re a \u201cvisual learner\u201d or an \u201cauditory learner\u201d does not mean anything when it comes to learning a language, you have a big problem if you acquired your first language by hearing it (like we all did) but apparently you\u2019re more of a \u201cvisual learner.\u201d It mostly comes down to the method used to study Japanese. There are other factors too, such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency. But I believe the method in the first place is very important. For example, if someone told you that you could learn to swim by reading a book about swimming, would you be able to swim after you finished that book? No. That is because this is a fundamentally flawed method - it does not work. What this guide aims to do is educate you on effective methods to study Japanese, so that you don\u2019t end up like the others that failed and instead succeed, all while having fun in your target language, and in this case, your target language is most likely Japanese. Back to the \u201cvisual learner\u201d and \u201cauditory learner\u201d thing, while it may be true for other fields of study, it is not valid for acquiring a language. We all acquire language in the same exact way, and that is through comprehensible input . I often come across people saying, \u201ceveryone learns differently\u201d and again, this may be true for other fields of study but not for language acquisition . Key word: acquisition. Learning vs. Acquisition \u00b6 Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar to what one experiences in school. The individual is given \u201cgrammar rules\u201d and/or a \u201cvocabulary list\u201d to remember. When it comes to communicating in the language, they recall these rules and vocab they have learned and try to use that to speak the language. According to Stephen Krashen, the leading linguist in language acquisition, this is less effective than acquisition. Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and subconscious process of which individuals need not be aware. What this actually means is, this process is fundamentally the same for everyone, hence natural and acquired pieces of language can be utilized intuitively , where the individual, in opposition to learning, does not need time to think and form sentences using learned grammar and vocabulary. And finally, subconscious means that the individual is unaware that the process is happening; the acquisition process may not feel like \u201clanguage learning\u201d and when new knowledge is acquired, the acquirer does not feel like they have learned anything. Acquisition requires meaningful interaction with the target language, during which the acquirer is focused on meaning rather than form. What this means is, one is not concerned with the form of the language they are hearing and/or their utterances but with the messages they are conveying and understanding. \u203b \u201cLearning Japanese\u201d may improperly refer to both acquiring and learning. So please keep that in mind. i+1 \u00b6 From Wikipedia: \u201c[The Input Hypothesis] states that learners progress in their knowledge of the language when they comprehend language input that is slightly more advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level of input \u201ci+1\u201d, where \u201ci\u201d is the learner\u2019s interlanguage and \u201c+1\u2033 is the next stage of language acquisition.\u201d In simple terms, i+1 means \u201cone [and no more than one] thing [piece of language] you do not yet know in the sentence\" Say if you were learning English and you heard the sentence, \"I'm playing the guitar\", but you didn't know the word \"playing\" . This sentence would be i+1 because you know all the words and grammar structures apart from \"playing\". This is also comprehensible input IF you understood the message it was conveying. Input & Comprehensible Input \u00b6 Input itself refers to listening and reading to native content in the target language. Mass input can be referred to as immersion . Native content means content made by natives, for natives. (Raw) Anime is made by natives, for natives, therefore it is native content. Comprehensible input refers to input where messages are conveyed and understood. It is the most crucial ingredient in the acquisition of language. Any input is not sufficient for acquisition, the input must be comprehensible . However, as a beginner, it may seem difficult to find comprehensible input, and that is true. I will touch later on how you can benefit from incomprehensible input , too, but not in the same way. Language is not acquired from incomprehensible input but from comprehensible input. So please keep that in mind. It is also important to keep in mind that talking (output) is not practicing a language. When people give anecdotes of how they got better at a language by speaking a lot, they do not realise that it was the input (from the partner) which improved their skill at the language. Speaking (output) is just the icing on the cake, and input is where you are actually acquiring language. Knowing whose advice to trust \u00b6 It may seem natural to take as much people\u2019s advice as you can, after all, they have experience right? Maybe you can learn something valuable? Well, not quite. If the person you are taking advice from has not achieved what you want to achieve, then you have no reason to trust their advice. If you do, then you will get no better than the low level they are at right now. As a beginner, you have no way to properly judge someone\u2019s language ability, as your linguistic competence of the language is very low, or virtually non existent, therefore you are no one to judge if your friend is really good at Japanese or not. Why is this important? Because I often come across people that say things like \u201cBut my friend that learns Japanese told me that\u2026\u201d and the thing that the friend told the other friend is usually pretty misguided and blatantly false. Has your friend achieved something close to what you want to achieve? If not, you do not have much luck getting past the low level they are at if you follow their advice. It would be like taking dieting advice from someone that's fat. \u201dLearning\u201d Japanese Effectively \u00b6 Now that you know the basics of language acquisition, let\u2019s dive into how to learn Japanese. Kana \u00b6 Kana refers to hiragana and katakana , they are the two scripts of the Japanese language. Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the same sounds in the language. Hiragana is used for words and names not written in kanji and for grammatical purposes. The writer can choose whether or not to use the kanji form. Katakana is used for words borrowed from other languages and foreign names, it can also be used for emphasis, however, the usages of hiragana and katakana are not always consistent, so take note of that. The kana is not hard to master and therefore I\u2019d say, learn it however you want. It\u2019s better if you have audio with it, too. Mnemonics may seem like a good idea, but I\u2019ve seen people complain that it makes the process of recalling the kana slower, so I\u2019d say just brute force it. You need to learn this first. I recommend you read Tae Kim and pause after The Writing System . After that you should copy out the chart below in a notebook or something similar. You may never need to use a pen ever again after this. The Chart: When you've done that you should go on DJT Kana and check all the kana by going in \"show/hide\" and test yourself. Make sure you also scroll down and check all for hiragana combinations and katakana/katakana combinations! Steps if you got confused: Read Tae Kim until you complete The Writing System Copy out the chart above into a notebook or something similar. Test yourself by using DJT Kana . Make sure you check all the kana by going in \"show/hide\" and test yourself. MAKE SURE you also scroll down and check all for hiragana combinations and katakana/katakana combinations! After a week or so, you should have all the kana nailed down. Kanji \u00b6 Kanji taught to Japanese 1st graders. Kanji, literally meaning \"Chinese Characters\" is the third part of the Japanese writing system. They are logographic and therefore much more complex than kana. There are 2136 kanji taught in the Japanese school system, however don\u2019t let this fool you. Around 3000 or more are used in daily life. Kanji are used when they are used. You will eventually understand what this means when you get a little more advanced in Japanese. Above is a page from the Love Live! Sunshine!! manga, showing hiragana, katakana and kanji. Approaching Kanji - Kanji With Vocab vs. Isolated Kanji Study There\u2019s two ways to approach kanji. One is kanji with vocab which is to learn words from reading without studying the individual kanji. You can fully comprehend \"\u5b88\u92ad\u5974\" without knowing what the individual kanji mean just by looking it up in a dictionary. The other is isolated kanji study which is studying the meaning and composition of the individual kanji. Example: \"\u5b88\"(guard)\"\u92ad\"(coin)\"\u5974\"(guy) = cheapskate. Huh? It\u2019s pretty smart. Isolated kanji study can make remembering vocab easier, but it can put you behind due to the amount of time it takes, so it is up to you to decide whether it is worth it. If you really struggle with reading words, then you should do isolated kanji study. \u203b Another interesting thing about kanji with vocab, is that if you know other words that also use the kanji of said word, it can become easier to remember. (Example: If you can comprehend \" \u5b88 \u8b77\", \" \u92ad \u6e6f\" and \"\u58f2\u56fd \u5974 \" then \" \u5b88\u92ad\u5974 \" becomes easier) How to: Kanji with Vocab This is the most simplest approach to kanji, and it is the approach I took personally. Most people will be able to read kana just by referring to the kana chart, but you can\u2019t do the same for kanji. So how do you learn to read kanji? Look at the manga picture above. Look at the first panel. You see \"\u4eba\u6570\"? That\u2019s a word. Look it up in a dictionary such as Jisho . You get the reading: \"\u306b\u3093\u305a\u3046 (ninzuu)\" and the meaning: \"number of people\". Cool, move on. That\u2019s it. But don\u2019t expect to remember words just by looking it up once, that is why you should read a lot to build up and retain kanji skill. At the end of the guide I will go through how to make the process of looking up words easier. How to: Isolated Kanji Study When approaching kanji as a beginner, they can look like scribbles rather than familiar shapes. Kanji have common shapes and patterns and Isolated Kanji Study helps you see those common shapes and patterns. Instead of \"\u8349\" looking like a random drawing, you can see that it\u2019s composed from \"\u8279\", \"\u65e5\" and \"\u5341\". An isolated kanji study method I recommend is RRTK 450 (Recognition Remembering the Kanji 450 Cards) which is designed to help you see kanji as familiar shapes. It is used in the application Anki. You can find more information about it below. RRTK Explained Get RRTK 450 With that said, to truly \u201clearn\u201d kanji, you still need to read Japanese for thousands of hours, so in the end, you\u2019re going to be doing kanji with vocab anyway. Think of isolated kanji study as your training wheels for kanji with vocab. Vocabulary \u00b6 The bulk of your language learning journey is learning vocabulary, so you will be doing a lot of it. Anki is a spaced repetition system (SRS) flashcard program. It is designed to help you remember information. You can get it here I recommend you start learning vocabulary using Anki after you have learned the kana and know extremely basic grammar. How basic is extremely basic is up to you to decide. I will go through how to study grammar after this section, so don't panic. You should use Anki to build up a vocabulary of basic words to assist your immersion, after that learning vocabulary from immersion, especially in reading, becomes easier. Usually people use the Core 2K deck to build up a vocabulary of 2000 words. It works by showing you the word you need to learn at the front, and it has the meaning and how to read it at the back, along with a voiced example sentence. You learn words with Core2K by recalling the meaning and reading of the displayed word. However, I advise against using Core 2K, and suggest you do Tango N5+N4 instead, and here\u2019s why: Core 2K is significantly harder than Tango N5+N4 because Tango has the sentence on the front, Core 2K has only the word on the front. Tango decks work by showing you a sentence at the front, and the piece of information (a meaning and reading) needed to understand the sentence at the back. The \"N\" number in the deck name refers to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), with N5 being the lowest, easiest and N1 being the highest. Sentences make recalling vocabulary easier, after all, it is much more close to how we use language in real life as opposed to isolated words. However, it is important to note that Tango's translations are not literal, and do not represent Japanese structure well, so I guess that's a flaw of Tango. In other cases, it might be utterly wrong. People have always struggled with Core 2K, and to make the process smoother, I recommend Tango N5+N4 over Core 2K. Especially if you don\u2019t want to do isolated kanji study! Mining \u00b6 Mining means when you add vocabulary (often along with the sentence they were found in) into your Anki deck. You can then review these flashcards overtime to make sure you don\u2019t forget them. It usually recommended you begin mining right after you finished Tango N5+N4. You should not bother with Tango N3, N2 and/or N1 because at this point you should be making your own flashcards from your immersion, which is overall a fun process. Mining is something you will be doing for a long time, so this is pretty darn important. There\u2019s a lot of disagreement when it comes to \u201cformats\u201d of mining, I think you should just experiment and see what works best for you. There are two main formats of mining: i+1 Sentence Cards and High Quality Vocab Cards (known as Anime Cards) There has been no settlement to which one is the \u201cbest\u201d, they each have their own benefits and drawbacks. i+1 Sentence Cards I+1 Sentence Cards are cards with an i+1 sentence with all its kanji on the front, and the piece of information needed to understand the sentence on the back. Let\u2019s go through the benefits and drawbacks. Benefits: + Easier to judge whether or not you should pass (as opposed to fail) the card, as the task is simple: understand the sentence without revealing the back. + Less likely to mix up similar words, as their sentences are different. + Easier overall, as sentences are closer to how we use language in real life. + I+1 format so inherently easier than the alternative. Drawbacks: - Long to review as you need to read the full sentence every time. - As it is i+1, this may restrict what words you can put in your Anki deck. As you can only add sentences where there is one piece of language you do not yet know. High Quality Vocab Cards High Quality vocab cards are different to standard vocab cards. Standard vocab cards simply have the word in kanji form on the front, and the reading and meaning of that word at the back. High quality vocab cards, as opposed to standard vocab cards, have the audio of the sentence (from an anime or voiced Visual Novel), also a picture (from an anime or Visual Novel) and the sentence it came from at the back. Making them much more superior to standard vocab cards. \u203b They are known as \u201cAnime Cards\u201d because of AnimeCards Site Benefits + Quick to review. I average 500 cards in 30 minutes with these. + Able to mine everything and anything (does not follow i+1) Drawbacks - Significantly harder than i+1 sentence cards. For the same reason Core 2K is harder than Tango N5+N4 . - Much more likely to mix up similar words. - Not beginner friendly. I do not recommend a beginner does this until they have at least 1000 i+1 sentence cards. - Words may not be learned as well as with i+1 sentence cards Grammar \u00b6 When approaching grammar, it is important to know that the purpose of a grammar guide is not to make you a master at the language, but to give you only a basic understanding of how things work in the language, and then a true understanding of grammar can only be achieved through immersion. Therefore, I recommend you choose a grammar guide, read/watch it and do immersion. Choosing a grammar guide There are many grammar guides out there, some are good, but some are bad. To prevent confusion amongst learners, i will only mention 2 grammar guides. Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. No grammar guide is perfect, they each have their ups and downs. Tae Kim is written pretty well, and very beginner friendly, however some of his explanations may be a little off and it can get boring to read. Cure Dolly takes an unorthodox approach to Japanese grammar, trying to teach Japanese grammar in a more Japanese \u201corganic\u201d way. However, Cure Dolly is not the most absolute beginner friendly, you need at least some background knowledge before using. Also, the audio is very poor. You can find the 2 grammar guides below: Tae Kim There is also an Android and iOS app for offline viewing!, note that everything in this guide is considered to be \"basic Japanese\", even the \u201cadvanced\u201d section Cure Dolly I recommend turning on subtitles and setting the speed to 1.25x! With that said, I suggest doing grammar study in conjunction with your immersion and vocabulary study. How to Immerse (inputting) \u00b6 What you need to do when immersing is different depending on what stage you are on. This is why making a one size fits all Japanese guide is difficult. I will only go through what you need to do as a beginner. Listening \u00b6 When you are a beginner, I recommend doing listening immersion over reading immersion. This is because when you first approach a foreign language, you are not yet used to the phonemes (sounds) of the language, so reading may give you a poor accent, this is when you associate similar, yet wrong phonemes from your native language to Japanese, it is impossible to read without mapping some phonetic component, so you can only avoid this by first getting used to the phonemes. You can only do this by doing raw listening. Secondly, listening just flows without stopping, so you feel more comfortable when immersing. On the other hand, reading as a beginner is very frustrating as you need to constantly look up words probably every second. Surprisingly, there are many i+1 opportunities in listening immersion as a beginner, so it still passes as comprehensible input, even if you don\u2019t understand other parts. But language is not acquired through incomprehensible input remember? That is true, however, you are still benefiting from incomprehensible input but in a different way; it is improving your ability to distinguish phonemes, in other words giving you a better accent. Immersing even if you don\u2019t understand much is also a great way to build up a habit of interacting with your target language. With that said though, immersion (input) at this stage will still be largely incomprehensible, however you can change that by working through the Tango Anki decks. Please note that you need to pay attention to your immersion. (Active Immersion). Just putting it on in the background (Passive Immersion) is not going to help you. Choosing what to immerse with It\u2019s usually best to immerse with something with a visual and audio component, such as anime and j-drama (TV Show). TV shows have a visual component, and also a plot, so this brings more i+1 opportunities. It is not recommended to immerse with say, a podcast or an audiobook as a beginner, as you will have no idea what\u2019s going on (incomprehensible input). If you are learning Japanese, then chances are you are a fan of anime, cool. You can use that to immerse, and even anime you have seen in the past. What is also pretty helpful is reading an episode summary of the episode on Wikipedia before watching it, this can help you understand the plot more, so you can make more acquisition gains. What do I need to be \u201cdoing\u201d while actively immersing? (As a beginner) Try to understand messages. There is a lot you can infer from a TV show. Like Krashen says, you need to have \u201cmeaningful\u201d (meaning focused) interaction with the language, rather than focusing on form (such as grammar). I suggest trying to hear the sounds more clearly, too? Reading \u00b6 Reading, no matter what stage you are at, can benefit you greatly. However, as a newbie to the language, there are a few problems when it comes to reading early on in the process. Reading early can have a bad effect on your accent. And your reading ability may not always transfer (being able to hear the new words you learned) to your listening ability, especially if your listening ability is considerably low. When you\u2019re a beginner, I recommend watching Japanese subtitled anime for reading practice. Japanese subtitles are reading immersion at best, similar to a voiced visual novel. Having the voices in the background isn\u2019t going to save your accent nor improve your listening skill, you need to do raw listening. Anyway, I think it is good to start out with Japanese subtitles for reading. And transition to manga, and then light novels and so on. I think it is important you pace yourself when reading and don\u2019t burn out trying to read hard novels as a beginner, it is usually better reading books that are not too far off from your level. In our Resources you can find links to sites that let you read a lot of Japanese manga and novels, for free. And Japanese subtitles too, so make sure you check that out! Finding the balance between listening and reading Balance is important. It may be obvious just to split your time up in half, and if you are able to do that, then that is great. However, not everyone has the time, and when it comes to reading, depending on your current level, it may be considerably difficult to read for extended hours. For example people that have gotten further in the Tango Anki deck may be able to read longer than those who are a little behind. So what is the perfect balance? I cannot answer that, that is up to you to experiment and decide. It all depends on your schedule and current level. You don\u2019t need to do reading from day 1, give it a few weeks until you can read basic words from the Tango N5 Anki deck. Now what? \u00b6 Learn the kana by copying out the entire chart posted in the Kana section into a notebook, or something similar. Use DJT Kana to test yourself. Make sure you check all the kana by going in \"show/hide\" and test yourself. MAKE SURE you also scroll down and check all for hiragana combinations and katakana/katakana combinations! After you have completed Kana, then you should move on to learning grammar alongside vocabulary.. It is important that you pace yourself and don\u2019t try to punch above your own weight, this is not a race. Download and set up Anki , read the manual and download & import the Tango N5 deck You can import the Tango N5 deck by clicking on it. It should open in Anki, wait a while for it to import. Click the cog icon next to the deck > Options. The default limit of new cards per day is set at 20. Try to stick with this number for a few days and see how it goes for you, if you feel like it is too much, then you can lower the limit to 15 or even 10. Check in the \u201cReviews\u201d tab, set the Maximum reviews/day to 9999. Don\u2019t be startled by this number. It will likely not go over 150 with okay retention rate. If you fail to keep up with the reviews you are getting, lower your new cards/day instead of lowering the maximum reviews. This is because not doing your due reviews interferes with Anki\u2019s spaced repetition system. Anki requires consistency in the long term for it to be effective, try creating a schedule for it. Personally I do my Anki when I wake up in the morning. Work on the Tango N5 Anki deck while reading/watching your chosen grammar guide. After you have finished Tango N5 , do Tango N4 , too. You should also be nearing the end of your grammar guide at this point. I also suggest starting to read manga at this point. After you finished Tango N4 . You should set up a mining deck. It doesn\u2019t matter that much which one you pick. Choose one below. High Quality Vocab Cards (\u201canime cards\u201d) I+1 Sentence Cards The process of learning Japanese is as follows: Ongoing Immersion is ongoing throughout this entire process. Keep this in mind. Tolerate the ambiguity . Learn the hiragana and katakana using the method as described above. Learn grammar using the method as described above. Download Anki and use the Tango N5 deck to learn basic words. After you finish the Tango N5 deck , move on to Tango N4 . After you finish Tango N4 , use Quizmaster's Anki Guide to learn how to mine. Once you are mining, the process of learning Japanese becomes as simple as reading Japanese and listening to Japanese everyday, and adding unknown words to your Anki flashcard deck. You should now be just immersing (inputting) and making flashcards everyday. Final Notes \u00b6 That\u2019s it. You can get fluent in Japanese just like that. But don\u2019t forget that the most important part is immersion, Anki and grammar only assist your immersion. Music is not immersion. However, you can use the lyric sheet as reading practice.

What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many people love the idea of being fluent, and being able to watch Japanese media without subtitles, in their raw form. However, many people also don\u2019t ever reach this goal, or even get close. I believe it mostly isn\u2019t their fault, but rather, the method \u2019s fault. Whether you\u2019re a \u201cvisual learner\u201d or an \u201cauditory learner\u201d does not mean anything when it comes to learning a language, you have a big problem if you acquired your first language by hearing it (like we all did) but apparently you\u2019re more of a \u201cvisual learner.\u201d It mostly comes down to the method used to study Japanese. There are other factors too, such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency. But I believe the method in the first place is very important. For example, if someone told you that you could learn to swim by reading a book about swimming, would you be able to swim after you finished that book? No. That is because this is a fundamentally flawed method - it does not work. What this guide aims to do is educate you on effective methods to study Japanese, so that you don\u2019t end up like the others that failed and instead succeed, all while having fun in your target language, and in this case, your target language is most likely Japanese. Back to the \u201cvisual learner\u201d and \u201cauditory learner\u201d thing, while it may be true for other fields of study, it is not valid for acquiring a language. We all acquire language in the same exact way, and that is through comprehensible input . I often come across people saying, \u201ceveryone learns differently\u201d and again, this may be true for other fields of study but not for language acquisition . Key word: acquisition.","title":"Why many people \u201cfail\u201d to learn Japanese"},{"location":"guide/#learning-vs-acquisition","text":"Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar to what one experiences in school. The individual is given \u201cgrammar rules\u201d and/or a \u201cvocabulary list\u201d to remember. When it comes to communicating in the language, they recall these rules and vocab they have learned and try to use that to speak the language. According to Stephen Krashen, the leading linguist in language acquisition, this is less effective than acquisition. Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and subconscious process of which individuals need not be aware. What this actually means is, this process is fundamentally the same for everyone, hence natural and acquired pieces of language can be utilized intuitively , where the individual, in opposition to learning, does not need time to think and form sentences using learned grammar and vocabulary. And finally, subconscious means that the individual is unaware that the process is happening; the acquisition process may not feel like \u201clanguage learning\u201d and when new knowledge is acquired, the acquirer does not feel like they have learned anything. Acquisition requires meaningful interaction with the target language, during which the acquirer is focused on meaning rather than form. What this means is, one is not concerned with the form of the language they are hearing and/or their utterances but with the messages they are conveying and understanding. \u203b \u201cLearning Japanese\u201d may improperly refer to both acquiring and learning.

Any input is not sufficient for acquisition, the input must be comprehensible . However, as a beginner, it may seem difficult to find comprehensible input, and that is true. I will touch later on how you can benefit from incomprehensible input , too, but not in the same way. Language is not acquired from incomprehensible input but from comprehensible input. So please keep that in mind. It is also important to keep in mind that talking (output) is not practicing a language. When people give anecdotes of how they got better at a language by speaking a lot, they do not realise that it was the input (from the partner) which improved their skill at the language.

Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the same sounds in the language. Hiragana is used for words and names not written in kanji and for grammatical purposes. The writer can choose whether or not to use the kanji form. Katakana is used for words borrowed from other languages and foreign names, it can also be used for emphasis, however, the usages of hiragana and katakana are not always consistent, so take note of that. The kana is not hard to master and therefore I\u2019d say, learn it however you want. It\u2019s better if you have audio with it, too. Mnemonics may seem like a good idea, but I\u2019ve seen people complain that it makes the process of recalling the kana slower, so I\u2019d say just brute force it. You need to learn this first.

Approaching Kanji - Kanji With Vocab vs. Isolated Kanji Study There\u2019s two ways to approach kanji. One is kanji with vocab which is to learn words from reading without studying the individual kanji. You can fully comprehend \"\u5b88\u92ad\u5974\" without knowing what the individual kanji mean just by looking it up in a dictionary. The other is isolated kanji study which is studying the meaning and composition of the individual kanji. Example: \"\u5b88\"(guard)\"\u92ad\"(coin)\"\u5974\"(guy) = cheapskate. Huh? It\u2019s pretty smart. Isolated kanji study can make remembering vocab easier, but it can put you behind due to the amount of time it takes, so it is up to you to decide whether it is worth it. If you really struggle with reading words, then you should do isolated kanji study. \u203b Another interesting thing about kanji with vocab, is that if you know other words that also use the kanji of said word, it can become easier to remember. (Example: If you can comprehend \" \u5b88 \u8b77\", \" \u92ad \u6e6f\" and \"\u58f2\u56fd \u5974 \" then \" \u5b88\u92ad\u5974 \" becomes easier) How to: Kanji with Vocab This is the most simplest approach to kanji, and it is the approach I took personally. Most people will be able to read kana just by referring to the kana chart, but you can\u2019t do the same for kanji. So how do you learn to read kanji? Look at the manga picture above. Look at the first panel. You see \"\u4eba\u6570\"? That\u2019s a word. Look it up in a dictionary such as Jisho . You get the reading: \"\u306b\u3093\u305a\u3046 (ninzuu)\" and the meaning: \"number of people\". Cool, move on. That\u2019s it. But don\u2019t expect to remember words just by looking it up once, that is why you should read a lot to build up and retain kanji skill. At the end of the guide I will go through how to make the process of looking up words easier. How to: Isolated Kanji Study When approaching kanji as a beginner, they can look like scribbles rather than familiar shapes. Kanji have common shapes and patterns and Isolated Kanji Study helps you see those common shapes and patterns. Instead of \"\u8349\" looking like a random drawing, you can see that it\u2019s composed from \"\u8279\", \"\u65e5\" and \"\u5341\". An isolated kanji study method I recommend is RRTK 450 (Recognition Remembering the Kanji 450 Cards) which is designed to help you see kanji as familiar shapes. It is used in the application Anki. You can find more information about it below. RRTK Explained Get RRTK 450 With that said, to truly \u201clearn\u201d kanji, you still need to read Japanese for thousands of hours, so in the end, you\u2019re going to be doing kanji with vocab anyway. Think of isolated kanji study as your training wheels for kanji with vocab.","title":"Kanji"},{"location":"guide/#vocabulary","text":"The bulk of your language learning journey is learning vocabulary, so you will be doing a lot of it. Anki is a spaced repetition system (SRS) flashcard program. It is designed to help you remember information. You can get it here I recommend you start learning vocabulary using Anki after you have learned the kana and know extremely basic grammar. How basic is extremely basic is up to you to decide. I will go through how to study grammar after this section, so don't panic. You should use Anki to build up a vocabulary of basic words to assist your immersion, after that learning vocabulary from immersion, especially in reading, becomes easier. Usually people use the Core 2K deck to build up a vocabulary of 2000 words. It works by showing you the word you need to learn at the front, and it has the meaning and how to read it at the back, along with a voiced example sentence. You learn words with Core2K by recalling the meaning and reading of the displayed word. However, I advise against using Core 2K, and suggest you do Tango N5+N4 instead, and here\u2019s why: Core 2K is significantly harder than Tango N5+N4 because Tango has the sentence on the front, Core 2K has only the word on the front. Tango decks work by showing you a sentence at the front, and the piece of information (a meaning and reading) needed to understand the sentence at the back. The \"N\" number in the deck name refers to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), with N5 being the lowest, easiest and N1 being the highest. Sentences make recalling vocabulary easier, after all, it is much more close to how we use language in real life as opposed to isolated words. However, it is important to note that Tango's translations are not literal, and do not represent Japanese structure well, so I guess that's a flaw of Tango. In other cases, it might be utterly wrong. People have always struggled with Core 2K, and to make the process smoother, I recommend Tango N5+N4 over Core 2K. Especially if you don\u2019t want to do isolated kanji study!","title":"Vocabulary"},{"location":"guide/#mining","text":"Mining means when you add vocabulary (often along with the sentence they were found in) into your Anki deck. You can then review these flashcards overtime to make sure you don\u2019t forget them. It usually recommended you begin mining right after you finished Tango N5+N4. You should not bother with Tango N3, N2 and/or N1 because at this point you should be making your own flashcards from your immersion, which is overall a fun process. Mining is something you will be doing for a long time, so this is pretty darn important. There\u2019s a lot of disagreement when it comes to \u201cformats\u201d of mining, I think you should just experiment and see what works best for you. There are two main formats of mining: i+1 Sentence Cards and High Quality Vocab Cards (known as Anime Cards) There has been no settlement to which one is the \u201cbest\u201d, they each have their own benefits and drawbacks. i+1 Sentence Cards I+1 Sentence Cards are cards with an i+1 sentence with all its kanji on the front, and the piece of information needed to understand the sentence on the back. Let\u2019s go through the benefits and drawbacks. Benefits: + Easier to judge whether or not you should pass (as opposed to fail) the card, as the task is simple: understand the sentence without revealing the back. + Less likely to mix up similar words, as their sentences are different. + Easier overall, as sentences are closer to how we use language in real life. + I+1 format so inherently easier than the alternative. Drawbacks: - Long to review as you need to read the full sentence every time. - As it is i+1, this may restrict what words you can put in your Anki deck. As you can only add sentences where there is one piece of language you do not yet know. High Quality Vocab Cards High Quality vocab cards are different to standard vocab cards. Standard vocab cards simply have the word in kanji form on the front, and the reading and meaning of that word at the back. High quality vocab cards, as opposed to standard vocab cards, have the audio of the sentence (from an anime or voiced Visual Novel), also a picture (from an anime or Visual Novel) and the sentence it came from at the back. Making them much more superior to standard vocab cards. \u203b They are known as \u201cAnime Cards\u201d because of AnimeCards Site Benefits + Quick to review. I average 500 cards in 30 minutes with these. + Able to mine everything and anything (does not follow i+1) Drawbacks - Significantly harder than i+1 sentence cards. For the same reason Core 2K is harder than Tango N5+N4 . - Much more likely to mix up similar words. - Not beginner friendly. I do not recommend a beginner does this until they have at least 1000 i+1 sentence cards. - Words may not be learned as well as with i+1 sentence cards","title":"Mining"},{"location":"guide/#grammar","text":"When approaching grammar, it is important to know that the purpose of a grammar guide is not to make you a master at the language, but to give you only a basic understanding of how things work in the language, and then a true understanding of grammar can only be achieved through immersion. Therefore, I recommend you choose a grammar guide, read/watch it and do immersion. Choosing a grammar guide There are many grammar guides out there, some are good, but some are bad. To prevent confusion amongst learners, i will only mention 2 grammar guides. Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. No grammar guide is perfect, they each have their ups and downs. Tae Kim is written pretty well, and very beginner friendly, however some of his explanations may be a little off and it can get boring to read. Cure Dolly takes an unorthodox approach to Japanese grammar, trying to teach Japanese grammar in a more Japanese \u201corganic\u201d way. However, Cure Dolly is not the most absolute beginner friendly, you need at least some background knowledge before using. Also, the audio is very poor. You can find the 2 grammar guides below: Tae Kim There is also an Android and iOS app for offline viewing!, note that everything in this guide is considered to be \"basic Japanese\", even the \u201cadvanced\u201d section Cure Dolly I recommend turning on subtitles and setting the speed to 1.25x! With that said, I suggest doing grammar study in conjunction with your immersion and vocabulary study.","title":"Grammar"},{"location":"guide/#how-to-immerse-inputting","text":"What you need to do when immersing is different depending on what stage you are on. This is why making a one size fits all Japanese guide is difficult. I will only go through what you need to do as a beginner.","title":"How to Immerse (inputting)"},{"location":"guide/#listening","text":"When you are a beginner, I recommend doing listening immersion over reading immersion. This is because when you first approach a foreign language, you are not yet used to the phonemes (sounds) of the language, so reading may give you a poor accent, this is when you associate similar, yet wrong phonemes from your native language to Japanese, it is impossible to read without mapping some phonetic component, so you can only avoid this by first getting used to the phonemes. You can only do this by doing raw listening. Secondly, listening just flows without stopping, so you feel more comfortable when immersing. On the other hand, reading as a beginner is very frustrating as you need to constantly look up words probably every second. Surprisingly, there are many i+1 opportunities in listening immersion as a beginner, so it still passes as comprehensible input, even if you don\u2019t understand other parts. But language is not acquired through incomprehensible input remember? That is true, however, you are still benefiting from incomprehensible input but in a different way; it is improving your ability to distinguish phonemes, in other words giving you a better accent. Immersing even if you don\u2019t understand much is also a great way to build up a habit of interacting with your target language. With that said though, immersion (input) at this stage will still be largely incomprehensible, however you can change that by working through the Tango Anki decks. Please note that you need to pay attention to your immersion. (Active Immersion). Just putting it on in the background (Passive Immersion) is not going to help you. Choosing what to immerse with It\u2019s usually best to immerse with something with a visual and audio component, such as anime and j-drama (TV Show). TV shows have a visual component, and also a plot, so this brings more i+1 opportunities. It is not recommended to immerse with say, a podcast or an audiobook as a beginner, as you will have no idea what\u2019s going on (incomprehensible input). If you are learning Japanese, then chances are you are a fan of anime, cool. You can use that to immerse, and even anime you have seen in the past. What is also pretty helpful is reading an episode summary of the episode on Wikipedia before watching it, this can help you understand the plot more, so you can make more acquisition gains. What do I need to be \u201cdoing\u201d while actively immersing? (As a beginner) Try to understand messages. There is a lot you can infer from a TV show. Like Krashen says, you need to have \u201cmeaningful\u201d (meaning focused) interaction with the language, rather than focusing on form (such as grammar). I suggest trying to hear the sounds more clearly, too?","title":"Listening"},{"location":"guide/#reading","text":"Reading, no matter what stage you are at, can benefit you greatly. However, as a newbie to the language, there are a few problems when it comes to reading early on in the process. Reading early can have a bad effect on your accent. And your reading ability may not always transfer (being able to hear the new words you learned) to your listening ability, especially if your listening ability is considerably low. When you\u2019re a beginner, I recommend watching Japanese subtitled anime for reading practice. Japanese subtitles are reading immersion at best, similar to a voiced visual novel. Having the voices in the background isn\u2019t going to save your accent nor improve your listening skill, you need to do raw listening. Anyway, I think it is good to start out with Japanese subtitles for reading. And transition to manga, and then light novels and so on. I think it is important you pace yourself when reading and don\u2019t burn out trying to read hard novels as a beginner, it is usually better reading books that are not too far off from your level. In our Resources you can find links to sites that let you read a lot of Japanese manga and novels, for free. And Japanese subtitles too, so make sure you check that out! Finding the balance between listening and reading Balance is important. It may be obvious just to split your time up in half, and if you are able to do that, then that is great. However, not everyone has the time, and when it comes to reading, depending on your current level, it may be considerably difficult to read for extended hours. For example people that have gotten further in the Tango Anki deck may be able to read longer than those who are a little behind. So what is the perfect balance? I cannot answer that, that is up to you to experiment and decide. It all depends on your schedule and current level. You don\u2019t need to do reading from day 1, give it a few weeks until you can read basic words from the Tango N5 Anki deck.","title":"Reading"},{"location":"guide/#now-what","text":"Learn the kana by copying out the entire chart posted in the Kana section into a notebook, or something similar. Use DJT Kana to test yourself. Make sure you check all the kana by going in \"show/hide\" and test yourself. MAKE SURE you also scroll down and check all for hiragana combinations and katakana/katakana combinations! After you have completed Kana, then you should move on to learning grammar alongside vocabulary.. It is important that you pace yourself and don\u2019t try to punch above your own weight, this is not a race. Download and set up Anki , read the manual and download & import the Tango N5 deck You can import the Tango N5 deck by clicking on it. It should open in Anki, wait a while for it to import. Click the cog icon next to the deck > Options. The default limit of new cards per day is set at 20. Try to stick with this number for a few days and see how it goes for you, if you feel like it is too much, then you can lower the limit to 15 or even 10. Check in the \u201cReviews\u201d tab, set the Maximum reviews/day to 9999. Don\u2019t be startled by this number. It will likely not go over 150 with okay retention rate. If you fail to keep up with the reviews you are getting, lower your new cards/day instead of lowering the maximum reviews. This is because not doing your due reviews interferes with Anki\u2019s spaced repetition system. Anki requires consistency in the long term for it to be effective, try creating a schedule for it. Personally I do my Anki when I wake up in the morning. Work on the Tango N5 Anki deck while reading/watching your chosen grammar guide. After you have finished Tango N5 , do Tango N4 , too. You should also be nearing the end of your grammar guide at this point. I also suggest starting to read manga at this point. After you finished Tango N4 . You should set up a mining deck. It doesn\u2019t matter that much which one you pick. Choose one below. High Quality Vocab Cards (\u201canime cards\u201d) I+1 Sentence Cards The process of learning Japanese is as follows: Ongoing Immersion is ongoing throughout this entire process. Keep this in mind. Tolerate the ambiguity . Learn the hiragana and katakana using the method as described above. Learn grammar using the method as described above. Download Anki and use the Tango N5 deck to learn basic words. After you finish the Tango N5 deck , move on to Tango N4 . After you finish Tango N4 , use Quizmaster's Anki Guide to learn how to mine. Once you are mining, the process of learning Japanese becomes as simple as reading Japanese and listening to Japanese everyday, and adding unknown words to your Anki flashcard deck. You should now be just immersing (inputting) and making flashcards everyday.","title":"Now what?"},{"location":"guide/#final-notes","text":"That\u2019s it.

You can't just \"learn\" a kanji because kanji has so much components to them that one cannot simply say they have apparently \"learned\" it. It's like saying, \"I learned a car\", \"I learned gaming\", heck even \"I learned Japanese\" for example. What on earth do you even mean when you say \"I'm learning kanji\"? This page will go through how useful isolated kanji study is, which is what most people do and think of when they say \"learn kanji\". We all should know that your long time kanji study will be Kanji with Vocab. With that said, let's see how useful isolated kanji study is! Learning the Meanings - Kind of Helpful \u00b6 Learning the meanings of a \"kanji\" is great if it's a word itself, such as \u9e93 \u3001 \u6e90 \u3001 \u529b etc. However, one can argue that you are literally learning a word not a kanji . Furthermore, learning the meanings for kanji can be useful for words like \u9023\u7d9a , \"take along, continue\" the kanji mean serial, consecutive . Remembering this can be helpful if you have constant trouble recalling the meaning of a certain word. However, the effectiveness of remembering meanings can be disputed. It is argued that these keywords assigned to kanji fade away as you get better at Japanese, and if you are good at Japanese and never studied kanji meanings, you would know what \u9023 means anyway. If you learn \u8336 as a word, you'll know it's tea . So if you come across \u7d05\u8336 and \u62b9\u8336 you may be able to guess that they are also some kind of tea . In addition to that, Japanese people would describe \u9023 as \" \u9023\u52dd \u306e\u9023\" or \" \u9023\u5c04 \u306e\u9023\" etc; not the keyword you learned. Summary: Kind of useful when you're a beginner, but not needed at all. Learning the Readings - A big NO. \u00b6 I'm not talking about learning words, like having \u5922\u4e2d along with a handy example sentence I mean this: Kanji: \u6daf Kun: \u306f\u3066 On: \u30ac\u30a4 \u2191 DON'T LEARN KANJI LIKE THIS \u2191 Learning kanji readings individually is a complete utter waste of time. Kanji readings are not consistent. Many kanji have multiple onyomi and kunyomi, for instance, \u5bb6\u8def [\u3044\u3048\u3058], \u901a\u8def [\u3064\u3046\u308d], \u5bb6\u8cc3 [\u3084\u3061\u3093], \u6f2b\u753b\u5bb6 ([\u307e\u3093\u304c\u304b], \u5c0f\u5b66\u6821 [\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304c\u3063\u3053\u3046], \u888b\u5c0f\u8def [\u3075\u304f\u308d\u3053\u3046\u3058], \u7d20\u8db3 [\u3059\u3042\u3057], \u7d20\u4eba [\u3057\u308d\u3046\u3068], \u604b\u4eba [\u3053\u3044\u3073\u3068], \u65e5\u672c\u4eba [\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3058\u3093], \u72e9\u4eba [\u304b\u308a\u3085\u3046\u3069] and our favourite: \u751f , \u5148\u751f [\u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044], \u751f\u6daf [\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304c\u3044], \u751f\u7c8b [\u304d\u3063\u3059\u3044], \u829d\u751f [\u3057\u3070\u3075], \u751f\u304d\u6b8b\u308b [\u3044\u304d\u306e\u3053\u308b], \u751f\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb [\u306a\u307e\u3073\u30fc\u308b], \u751f\u771f\u9762\u76ee [\u304d\u307e\u3058\u3081], \u751f\u3044\u8302\u308b [\u304a\u3044\u3057\u3052\u308b] Furthermore, it is also difficult remembering kanji in this way: \u6daf Kun: \u306f\u3066 On: \u30ac\u30a4 It's much easier remembering it in a word, like \u751f\u6daf on an Anki card or something. If you learned \u6d99\u817a \u300c\u308b\u3044\u305b\u3093\u300d and come across \u71b1\u6d99 , you will obviously be able to read the \u6d99 portion as \u308b\u3044, am I not wrong? In addition, the readings will be easier to remember in context of real words that you can actually use. Essentially, memorizing the readings by themselves is a complete waste of time. Summary: Useless. Don't learn readings, learn words. Learning the Stroke Order - Essential \u00b6 Learning the stroke order is essential, now I don't mean it in the sense of actively try to remember every stroke order for every new character, no, I mean getting down the basics, that way you can get the stroke order for new characters right with 90% accuracy, for example the rules for writing boxes like \u53e3 and what goes inside them, or rules for how to order the vertical and horizontal strokes when they cross each other like \u4e95 or \u8279 or \u738b or \u4e30 or \u7f8a etc. How \u5df1 is written which can be applied to \u8d77, the bottom portion of that can be learned by learning the strokes for \u8db3. Learning the first stroke of \u30c1 (katakana) can be applied to \u79c1 which can be applied to \u9999 and \u99a8. This isn't the same thing as RTK, that's different, but similar. It all connects. Of course, for awkward characters like \u98db you might need to look up the stroke order. But after you get the basics down for say, \u62bc, and \u8eca, writing something you don't know like \u63ee won't be a problem Summary: Essential, but don't overdo yourself. Learning how to write them - Depends \u00b6 This isn't the same thing as what I just talked about last time. Unfortunately, even if you literally know the word and the stroke order of the kanji that compose the word, it is very likely that when it actually comes to writing the word, you won't be able to recall how to write it. This problem can be overcome by individually learning how to write each word. You can do this by writing out sentences (don't write isolated words, write sentences, this helps with proportions). However, the utility value of this can be disputed. With today's technology, do you really need to learn how to write all those words? Probably not. You can just input it into your IME. With this said, consider your priorities, if you work in Japan and need to write Japanese as a part of your job this will obviously be essential for you. If not, then personally I don't see the point. Summary: Depends. Conclusion - learn words \u00b6 I hate the phrase, \"I am learning kanji\", it makes no sense. Every time someone says that they obviously don't know what they've supposedly learned is, to put it simply, useless. Whatever fancy cool way to remember all those wow so much >2,000 kanji (RTK, KKLC, WaniKani etc.) you use, you still need to read Japanese for hundreds of hours and remember a lot of vocabulary to truly \"learn a kanji\". I don't consider a kanji \"learned\" unless you know all the common words that use the kanji and are able to write it completely from memory. Don't \"learn kanji\", learn words. Don't \"learn\" kanji, feel kanji.

Unfortunately, even if you literally know the word and the stroke order of the kanji that compose the word, it is very likely that when it actually comes to writing the word, you won't be able to recall how to write it. This problem can be overcome by individually learning how to write each word. You can do this by writing out sentences (don't write isolated words, write sentences, this helps with proportions). However, the utility value of this can be disputed. With today's technology, do you really need to learn how to write all those words? Probably not. You can just input it into your IME. With this said, consider your priorities, if you work in Japan and need to write Japanese as a part of your job this will obviously be essential for you.

This guide will go through what the monolingual transition is and why you should do it, different mediums to access monolingual dictionaries and also ways to approach getting used to monolingual dictionaries. This guide is long. But it is still simple, it\u2019s just the initial setup that just feels long. What is the monolingual transition \u00b6 The monolingual transition is when you \u201ctransition\" into getting used to a monolingual dictionary, often with the help of a bilingual dictionary as an aid. A monolingual dictionary is a dictionary that defines words of the language in that language. For example, the Oxford Dictionary is a monolingual English dictionary. The K\u014djien (\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1) is a monolingual Japanese dictionary. Sites such as Jisho.org use the Japanese-English bilingual dictionary known as \u201cJMdict (English)\u201d. Jisho.org is not its own dictionary, it is only a portal that accesses JMdict. So keep that in mind. Why you should use a monolingual dictionary \u00b6 Monolingual dictionaries help you avoid making false associations with words from your native language (probably English) to Japanese. You may think, oh, what if I\u2019m not even English? If you don\u2019t use a monolingual dictionary, then you will make false associations anyway, no matter what your native language is. What if I\u2019m German and I use the Wadoku (Japanese-German bilingual dictionary)? Same thing. You will still have this problem. There is no language that can express Japanese better than Japanese itself. What exactly do you mean by \u201cfalse associations\u201d? \u00b6 Bilingual definitions, 90% of the time are very vague, and do not capture the true feeling of the word. You may not think so, but I\u2019ve been using monolingual dictionaries for a long time now and I can confirm bilingual definitions (especially those from the JMdict) do not capture the true feel of the word. Here\u2019s an example: \u6094\u3057\u3044 [\u304f\u3084\u3057\u3044] If you have been learning Japanese for a few months, you would know this word. And chances are you learned it using a bilingual dictionary. Let\u2019s look at the bilingual definition. vexing; annoying You may think, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s so vague to the point that it is literally wrong. Now let\u2019s look at the monolingual definition. Taken from the Hybrid Shinjirin (\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797) \u5931\u6557\u3084\u6065\u8fb1\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u3066\uff0c\u3042\u304d\u3089\u3081\u305f\u308a\u5fd8\u308c\u305f\u308a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3055\u307e\u3002 My amazing translation of the definition: Go through failure and dishonour and not being able to give up nor forget (about it). And this gets less accurate when you put it into English lmao. Did you get that from \u201cvexing, annoying\u201d? No. Probably not. Not convinced? Let\u2019s go through another example. \u60aa\u3044 [\u308f\u308b\u3044] Let me ask you one thing. What do you think this word means? If you answered, \u201cbad\u201d. Then you\u2019re only half wrong. This word is not equal to the English word \u201cbad\u201d. You can\u2019t use \u60aa\u3044 to say that your skill at something is inferior/poor, like you can in English. You use a completely different word in Japanese, and that\u2019s \u4e0b\u624b [\u3078\u305f]. See? And this is only scratching the surface of this problem. The other reason why you should use monolingual definitions is because they help you think in Japanese. Like I said before, there is no language that can express Japanese as well as Japanese itself can. Dictionary definitions are a way of thinking about words. I\u2019m sure dictionary authors (who are native speakers) put thought into each of their definitions when they wrote their definition, so by reading the definition and memorising it, you will have something at least close to what a native speaker may think of the word. If you learn words using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary (such as JMdict) then you will have a GAIJIN way of thinking about things, and not even close to what a native may think about the word. This will set you back in getting a true understanding of the word. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still get a true understanding with immersion, it just takes a lot longer than if you learned those words monolingually. Monolingual dictionaries are very powerful, and you will only realise this once they become second nature to you. Why people find it hard to go monolingual. \u00b6 Two reasons: They don\u2019t know the words. Nihonjin way of thinking (only applies to very few dictionary definitions such as \u5446\u308c\u308b) Monolingual transition myths \u00b6 A profound belief that \"dictionary vocabulary\" exist. Primarily due to poor wording by Matt. The truth: \u201cDictionary vocabulary\u201d = words you don\u2019t know because you don\u2019t read enough. Hey shoui, are you also going to say that \u4f53\u8a00 and \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 are also \u201ccommon words\u201d? Yes. You are only asking me this because you looked up \u201c\u3092\u201d and other particles in the monolingual dictionary. They appeared because you asked them to. They are linguistic words so they need to be used to explain grammar, that\u2019s it. Where else do you hear stuff like \u201cpassive form\u201d and \u201cnominalization\u201d outside of language learning websites? Exactly. 99% of dictionary definitions don\u2019t use that linguistic jargon, except for maybe \u6253\u3061\u6d88\u3057 (I\u2019ve heard this in anime by the way so you need to know it). I\u2019ve seen \u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 used in a Twitter account that posts about Japanese grammar/linguistics by the way, so it is common when you look at Japanese grammar in Japanese Using Morphman to assist the monolingual transition \u00b6 No. Morphman is an Anki addon (?) which automatically decides what words to add to Anki for you. And for that reason it is a failure. Don\u2019t leave it up to a silly computer program to help you decide what to add to Anki. Also most of what Morphman decides what to add for you is like \u201c\u30d5\u30a5...\u201d, \u201c(\u266a\uff5e)\u201d, \u201c\u3042\u3063...\u201d so unless you\u2019re into that I advise you to avoid using Morphman. If you want guidelines on what to mine, then just mine every single word after you have read/watched it. The idea here is, when you are looking up stuff, it is inevitable you are going to remember some things but forget others, so when you go back and read/watch it again, you mine all the words you failed to remember the first time. You may think, \u201cI probably don\u2019t need those words though\u201d. Wrong. Yes you do. You need every word that comes up in your immersion. Yomichan - the better way to go monolingual. \u00b6 I recommend doing the monolingual transition with Yomichan. Yomichan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Japanese words on a webpage by holding Shift and hovering over it. It is supported by any Chromium or Firefox based browser. You can find out how to set up Yomichan here Optimizing Yomichan Settings \u00b6 First you need to ensure that Advanced options is enabled. Second, we want to remove any and all scan delays because we will be making heavy use of this extension and wouldn't want to be slowed down by anything. Now we will enable scanning within pop-ups, this is very important, as we want to be able to look up any words we don't know within a definiton. You may want to increase the size of your Yomichan pop up window because by default it is pretty small and will become a hindrance when using monolingual dictionaries. To make enough headroom to use Yomichan dictionaries comfortably we are going to edit the following settings. Here's how our pop up looks now: Next, if you want, you don't need to but I recommend it, enable automatic audio playback, so we know how to pronounce a word correctly the moment we look it up. Also add the extra audio source because surprisingly it adds extra audio! I will touch on dictionaries in the next section. Getting and using monolingual dictionaries \u00b6 Again, I recommend you use monolingual dictionaries with Yomichan. I will talk about alternatives later. Download shoui Yomichan Dictionaries pack v5 Extract the .7z file (You can use 7-Zip for this), and you will be greeted with some .zip files. Do not tamper with these. These are our Yomichan dictionaries. No you don't need to import all of them. Before we continue, have a read on recommended dictionaries and what they are exactly. Recommended Dictionaries \u00b6 Here\u2019s what I recommend for first time monolingual users: \u00b6 \u660e\u93e1\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797 \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e94\u7248 \u5b9f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe\u8f9e\u5178 JMdict (English) \u7814\u7a76\u793e \u65b0\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\uff15\u7248 \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9 KireiCake For general, 100% monolingual coverage: \u00b6 \u5927\u8f9e\u6797 \u7b2c\u4e09\u7248 \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9 \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e94\u7248 \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e03\u7248 \u660e\u93e1\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u5b9f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe\u8f9e\u5178 \u7cbe\u9078\u7248 \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 \u5ca9\u6ce2\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1 \u7b2c\u516d\u7248 \u6f22\u5b57\u6e90 Every Dictionary Explained. \u00b6 Monolingual \u00b6 \u65b0\u660e\u89e3\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\u4e03\u7248 - 7th edition of Shinmeikai. Very verbose and precise with their definitions, always uses easy language, written from the ground up, instead of being based on old Meiji era dictionaries like the rest. This is the smallest dictionary. 7th edition has weird formatting so I kept the 5th edition in the pack, I recommend you use the 5th edition instead to not clutter your Yomichan. Will be fixed soon. \u660e\u93e1\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 - 1st edition of Meikyou. Very concise and compact, has expressions, always uses easy language. #1 recommended for first time monolingual users. Best for definitions on Anki cards. Second smallest. However, the current version we have has \u672a\u53ce\u9332\u8a9e but I have the source for the full version, will get it converted soon. \u5927\u8f9e\u6797 \u7b2c\u4e09\u7248 - 3rd edition of Daijirin. One of the bigger dictionaries, a great all rounder, has names such as place names, common names and famous people too. I would put this next to Daijisen. \u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9 - \"Digital Daijisen\" - The KING of online dictionaries, now in Yomichan. It has an extra 120,000 entries over the original Dajisen. Highly recommend. If you are using animecards.site's handlebars.js, I recommend you do not put this as your topmost dictionary as the first definition will get cut out when sent to the Anki card. Working on a fix. \u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1 \u7b2c\u516d\u7248, \u4ed8\u5c5e\u8cc7\u6599 - 6th edition of Koujien, the most authoritative dictionary in Japan. Language is a bit on the trickier side for beginners. It is one of the bigger dictionaries. Definitions are ordered by oldest to newest and are usually boring. This dictionary has a certain charm I like though. \u5ca9\u6ce2\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 - 6th edition of Iwanami dictionary. This is the dictionary Google uses when you search \"\u3007\u3007 \u5b9a\u7fa9\"\u3001\"\u3007\u3007 \u5b9a\u7fa9\"\u3068\u306f\u3001 and/or \"\u3007\u3007 \u610f\u5473\". The definitions \" feel like the Meikyou \". \u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797 - Daijirin's little brother, Shinjirin. The best thing about it is its concise definitions and how it has separate entries for different kanji variants like \u6483\u3064 vs \u6253\u3064. Highly recommended for beginners. \u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 - \"Kokugodaijiten\" - A certain version of the \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, the biggest Japanese dictionary in the world. But this is only about 1/10 of that dictionary but still bigger than the Daijirin. Has the same error as Shinjirin. Example:\u304b\u3048\u3063\u3066 It is optional and probably pointless. Superseded by \u7cbe\u9078\u7248. \u7cbe\u9078\u7248 \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 - \"Seisenban\" - Another version of the \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, but this is about 5/10 of that dictionary, but still the biggest digital dictionary to date. It has a heavy emphasis on classical Japanese, example sentences are like 500 years old and can appear to look crazy difficult, but it really comes through when you look up a word that's only in this dictionary. Keep it enabled to fill in gaps. \u5b9f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe\u8f9e\u5178 - Lets call this Jitsuyou. This is one of the dictionaries Weblio uses, and whatever gap was still left after all the dictionaries above, will be filled in with this dictionary. Very useful, it's at the bottom of my order because it's only needed when the other dictionaries don't have a word. \u6545\u4e8b\u3053\u3068\u308f\u3056\u8f9e\u5178 - a proverbs dictionary. Optional. Weblio\u53e4\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 - archaism dictionary Weblio uses. Very optional. \u6f22\u5b57\u6e90 - monolingual kanji dictionary with some very rare words too. Keep if you want to mine individual kanji. \u5b66\u7814\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178\u53e4\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178\u6545\u4e8b\u3053\u3068\u308f\u3056\u8f9e\u5178\u5b66\u7814\u6f22\u548c\u5927\u5b57\u5178 - the WORST dictionary ever. Do not import. Don't believe me? Import it then. Bilingual \u00b6 JMDict (English) - The dictionary Jisho.org uses. This is the most popular bilingual dictionary and you have already probably used it. Pretty much every Japanese-English dictionary project uses JMDict, apps like Shirabe Jisho on iOS, Akebi and Takoboto on Android all use JMDict. The biggest flaw of this dictionary (apart from it being bilingual) is how it has no example sentences. KireiCake - Based on an older version of JMDict but includes extra entries for slang. You may often see duplicate entries when used in tandem with JMDict, but for the entries that are exclusive to KireiCake, you should keep it. \u7814\u7a76\u793e \u65b0\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\uff15\u7248 - Kenkyuusha New Japanese-English Dictionary, 5th Edition, a Japanese-English dictionary intended for Japanese people. It has many example sentences which can prove to be very useful for Japanese learners. Better than JMDict. \u65b0\u548c\u82f1 - Version of \u7814\u7a76\u793e \u65b0\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 \u7b2c\uff15\u7248 without example sentences. Not recommended. \u7814\u7a76\u793e\u9732\u548c\u8f9e\u5178 - Kenkyuusha Russian-Japanese Dictionary. Self explanatory. Only included this because why not. Do not import if you are not a speaker of Russian. \u5927\u4fee\u9928\u66f8\u5e97\u4e2d\u65e5\u5927\u8f9e\u5178\u3000\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7248 - Taishuukan Chinese-Japanese Dictionary, 2nd edition. A simplified Chinese dictionary for speakers of Japanese. If you are ever going to learn simplified Chinese, I recommend this. Do not import if not a learner of Chinese. \u8d85\u7d1a\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u65e5\u4e2d\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 - Choukyuu Crown Chinese-Japanese Dictionary. Something Matt gave me, but it is broken, this is also a Chinese-Japanese dictionary that supports both traditional and simplified. Do not import if not a learner of Chinese. Continuation: Getting and using monolingual dictionaries \u00b6 Let's continue. Import the set of dictionaries that best suits you in Recommended Dictionaries . You can change dictionary priority so you can match the order by editing the number next to the dictionary. Higher the number = higher up in list. Why do you say use a lot of dictionaries? \u00b6 You need to have a lot of dictionaries and have every one of them enabled because there will always be some words that are in some dictionaries and not in others. Take for example \u79bf\u540c, that is only in \u5b9f\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8868\u73fe\u8f9e\u5178, and \u9662\u8a66, which is only in \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178. We want to use monolingual dictionaries as much as possible here.

Digital Dictionary Formats \u00b6 You can see: Japanese MDict (MDX) Dictionaries - newer, open source, up to date and lower in size. Encoded in UTF-8 which is a nice bonus for anyone wanting to convert these to other formats. Japanese EPWING Dictionaries - old, extremely esoteric but popular in \u96fb\u5b50\u8f9e\u66f8's from the 90's. Some are extremely bloated in file size. Encoded in EUC-JP which is a big spit in the face for anyone wanting to do any conversion with them. Approaching Monolingual Dictionaries \u00b6 There\u2019s a few ways to approach getting used to monolingual dictionaries. I\u2019ll go through each one of them. Primarily in the AJATT community, there\u2019s this one piece of advice: The \u201cThrow away the bilingual dictionary forever, and start using the monolingual dictionary straight away!\u201d Approach \u00b6 This is something Khatzumoto of AJATT proposed. I mean, if you read novels, this may be a pretty good approach, because you will already be familiar with the words, because novels generally just have more words than anime and manga. If you only watch anime and read manga, this may prove to be quite frustrating. When this piece of advice was put out, Yomichan didn\u2019t exist. So people in that time would have found this piece of advice terrible and tiring to constantly look up everything in the definitions. This isn\u2019t a fundamentally flawed approach, I think it\u2019s pretty good how it says \u201cjust read the dictionary more!\u201d, because that\u2019s exactly what you need to do. I just disagree with throwing away the bilingual dictionary completely, because you still need it in the beginning of the monolingual transition. The Morphman Approach \u00b6 no What you SHOULD do \u00b6 How did I learn how to be comfortable with monolingual dictionaries? I read more. (novels, light novels, visual novels) When I read more novels I got more used to written Japanese, and when I looked up words, they were in monolingual, so when I learned more words, I got better at using the monolingual dictionary. Huh? Yeah. It\u2019s really that simple. Read more. Read the novel more = reading the dictionary more because you need a dictionary to read novels :) >What did you do when you came across a word you didn\u2019t know in the definition? \u00b6 I looked it up with Yomichan. I tried reading the monolingual definition. If there were too many words I didn\u2019t know in the definition, I just looked at the English definition (as a last resort) and moved on. You just need to keep doing this. REPETITION. Read more books. You will get comfortable with the monolingual dictionary if you just read a lot. Yes. Read more. Read a lot. That\u2019s all there is to it. Yomichan just makes the process easier, you don\u2019t waste your energy manually searching, instead your energy goes into actually reading. That\u2019s why I recommend using Yomichan. >Soo\u2026 what\u2019s the best way to approach monolingual? \u00b6 Read more novels with a monolingual dictionary. I recommend reading novels on Itazuraneko using Yomichan. >But wouldn\u2019t I be reading the dictionary more than the actual novel? \u00b6 So what? It\u2019s good that you are reading the dictionary more. 10 Important Tips and Tricks \u00b6 (\u58f1). Read at least 1 novel (it can be a light novel or visual novel) before going monolingual. (\u5f10). Try to experiment with what dictionary order is the best for you. (\u53c2). If the word you look up with Yomichan is only in bilingual, try doing a kana search for it (\u8086). If you don\u2019t understand the definition even if you looked up all the words, just look at/use the bilingual definition (last resort). You will get better at understanding when you use it more. (\u4f0d). It is okay to check the bilingual definition to check that you\u2019re getting the right basic idea. (\u9678). Don\u2019t worry about how much time it will take to \u201ctransition\u201d (\u6f06). For monolingual Anki cards, just try to remember the gist of the definition. I tried to demonstrate this in Japanese FAQ (\u634c). Try to look up words you already know, in the monolingual dictionary, this is just to try to get accustomed to the dictionary at first hand. (\u7396). Forget looking up very concrete nouns such as animals in the monolingual dictionary, you are better off just using Google Images instead. (\u62fe). Don\u2019t overdo yourself! If it's too hard, try to use the bilingual dictionary until you feel confident again!

A monolingual dictionary is a dictionary that defines words of the language in that language. For example, the Oxford Dictionary is a monolingual English dictionary. The K\u014djien (\u5e83\u8f9e\u82d1) is a monolingual Japanese dictionary. Sites such as Jisho.org use the Japanese-English bilingual dictionary known as \u201cJMdict (English)\u201d. Jisho.org is not its own dictionary, it is only a portal that accesses JMdict. So keep that in mind.","title":"What is the monolingual transition"},{"location":"monolingual/#why-you-should-use-a-monolingual-dictionary","text":"Monolingual dictionaries help you avoid making false associations with words from your native language (probably English) to Japanese. You may think, oh, what if I\u2019m not even English? If you don\u2019t use a monolingual dictionary, then you will make false associations anyway, no matter what your native language is. What if I\u2019m German and I use the Wadoku (Japanese-German bilingual dictionary)? Same thing. You will still have this problem. There is no language that can express Japanese better than Japanese itself.","title":"Why you should use a monolingual dictionary"},{"location":"monolingual/#what-exactly-do-you-mean-by-false-associations","text":"Bilingual definitions, 90% of the time are very vague, and do not capture the true feeling of the word. You may not think so, but I\u2019ve been using monolingual dictionaries for a long time now and I can confirm bilingual definitions (especially those from the JMdict) do not capture the true feel of the word. Here\u2019s an example: \u6094\u3057\u3044 [\u304f\u3084\u3057\u3044] If you have been learning Japanese for a few months, you would know this word. And chances are you learned it using a bilingual dictionary. Let\u2019s look at the bilingual definition. vexing; annoying You may think, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s so vague to the point that it is literally wrong. Now let\u2019s look at the monolingual definition. Taken from the Hybrid Shinjirin (\u30cf\u30a4\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c9\u65b0\u8f9e\u6797) \u5931\u6557\u3084\u6065\u8fb1\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3057\u3066\uff0c\u3042\u304d\u3089\u3081\u305f\u308a\u5fd8\u308c\u305f\u308a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3055\u307e\u3002 My amazing translation of the definition: Go through failure and dishonour and not being able to give up nor forget (about it). And this gets less accurate when you put it into English lmao. Did you get that from \u201cvexing, annoying\u201d? No. Probably not. Not convinced? Let\u2019s go through another example. \u60aa\u3044 [\u308f\u308b\u3044] Let me ask you one thing. What do you think this word means? If you answered, \u201cbad\u201d. Then you\u2019re only half wrong. This word is not equal to the English word \u201cbad\u201d. You can\u2019t use \u60aa\u3044 to say that your skill at something is inferior/poor, like you can in English. You use a completely different word in Japanese, and that\u2019s \u4e0b\u624b [\u3078\u305f]. See? And this is only scratching the surface of this problem. The other reason why you should use monolingual definitions is because they help you think in Japanese. Like I said before, there is no language that can express Japanese as well as Japanese itself can. Dictionary definitions are a way of thinking about words. I\u2019m sure dictionary authors (who are native speakers) put thought into each of their definitions when they wrote their definition, so by reading the definition and memorising it, you will have something at least close to what a native speaker may think of the word. If you learn words using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary (such as JMdict) then you will have a GAIJIN way of thinking about things, and not even close to what a native may think about the word. This will set you back in getting a true understanding of the word. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still get a true understanding with immersion, it just takes a lot longer than if you learned those words monolingually. Monolingual dictionaries are very powerful, and you will only realise this once they become second nature to you.","title":"What exactly do you mean by \u201cfalse associations\u201d?"},{"location":"monolingual/#why-people-find-it-hard-to-go-monolingual","text":"Two reasons: They don\u2019t know the words.

If you want guidelines on what to mine, then just mine every single word after you have read/watched it.

If you only watch anime and read manga, this may prove to be quite frustrating. When this piece of advice was put out, Yomichan didn\u2019t exist. So people in that time would have found this piece of advice terrible and tiring to constantly look up everything in the definitions. This isn\u2019t a fundamentally flawed approach, I think it\u2019s pretty good how it says \u201cjust read the dictionary more!\u201d, because that\u2019s exactly what you need to do.

If you don\u2019t understand the definition even if you looked up all the words, just look at/use the bilingual definition (last resort). You will get better at understanding when you use it more. (\u4f0d). It is okay to check the bilingual definition to check that you\u2019re getting the right basic idea. (\u9678). Don\u2019t worry about how much time it will take to \u201ctransition\u201d (\u6f06). For monolingual Anki cards, just try to remember the gist of the definition. I tried to demonstrate this in Japanese FAQ (\u634c). Try to look up words you already know, in the monolingual dictionary, this is just to try to get accustomed to the dictionary at first hand. (\u7396). Forget looking up very concrete nouns such as animals in the monolingual dictionary, you are better off just using Google Images instead. (\u62fe). Don\u2019t overdo yourself!

It is important you learn how to read Japanese. Often you get people asking \"Well can I learn Japanese without learning how to read it?\". You can, provided you don't want to understand basic grammar and have a tiny vocabulary size after years of study. With that said, it may seem difficult to learn how to read, after all there are like 3000 unique kanji on the page! Well yes, reading for the first time will always be painful, you just have to get through it and over time you will become more confident and better at reading. And if anyone is curious on how on earth you're supposed to look up Japanese words in a dictionary, just read on, there are certain tools that let you do this easily. Before you start reading for real, it is important you have already worked through a pre-made Anki deck, such as Tango N5+N4 or Core3k and also a grammar guide such as Tae Kim or Cure Dolly, this is to make the process less painful as there will be more words you know. Second, I recommend also having prior listening immersion experience because 1. it prevents you from developing a bad accent and 2. it helps you parse sentences better when reading. Key Points \u00b6 Learning to read will always be painful in the start. You shouldn't wait \"until you're ready\" because you will never be ready until you start reading. It is not recommended you start reading without prior listening experience. Don't worry about not comprehending a sentence no matter how much times you read it, in other words, learn to tolerate ambiguity . Things will become clearer as you read more. If you hate reading books in general, you can always play visual novels or read manga, both of which are very good for reading. Your first light novel/book whatever will always be the most painful. Get through it no matter how painful it is or how long is takes you. Don't rush yourself. Take your time. Go at your own pace. You wouldn't want to burnout and end up never reading again or anything. Learning how to read \u00b6 As mentioned earlier, make sure you have an adequate vocabulary size and a grasp of Japanese grammar before reading, this will make things much easier. Japanese subtitles \u00b6 Japanese subtitles are a good way to introduce yourself to reading, assuming you already understand a fine amount in raw, trying to read the subtitles can be good reading practice. However make them something quick to let go of and in the future only consider using Japanese subtitles for mining instead of for reading. Manga \u00b6 Manga is probably the best way to get into reading without it being too intimidating as the way its written is similar to spoken Japanese, and assuming you're already quite familiar with that, it won't be much of a trouble getting used to. Manga: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica As you can see, manga uses all 3 writing systems, hiragana, katakana and kanji, therefore manga can be a great way to practice your skills in all 3 fields. But how about looking up words? That's literally a scan isn't it? Use the tool KanjiTomo and hover over the text, and it will automatically look it up, but it's a bit quirky and doesn't always work, in that case, you can use Capture2text , set the OCR language to Japanese and highlight the text you want and it will copy it onto your clipboard, after that you can paste it into Jisho . It's actually quicker than it sounds. If Capture2Text fails, then use the Google Translate handwriting feature. No matter how badly you write the kanji, it will detect it. After that you can copy and paste it into Jisho. Expect manga to be pretty hard for you at first, but over time it will smoothen out and get easier. You just need to read more. You just need to read a lot. Light Novels \u00b6 Even if you read like 100 manga, you still need to read light novels since you need to learn literary Japanese. Literary Japanese is not that hard as it sounds, it's only slightly different from spoken Japanese and will be easy to get used to. For reading light novels, I recommend using Yomichan , you can find a detailed Yomichan setup tutorial [here] I seriously recommend you read novels on this site: Itazuraneko Old Library , sort by kanji count, usually 1,000-1,600 kanji count is a good, this just means how long the book is if you actually look at it. Your first light novel will be extremely painful, but your second light novel won't be as painful. Expect a light novel to take a month or so to finish reading when you're first starting out, it will get quicker overtime (I can finish a light novel in a week, a day if all I did was read). Just read more, read a lot. Reading scans or physicals like these is not recommended. Note: I am not speaking against \u7e26\u66f8\u304d, (vertical), the image below is an example of a scan . Novel: Hibike! Euphonium Novel: Nichijou no Natsuyasumi You need to read stuff like this: Novel: Kimi no Na wa. Click to enlarge This is digital . Very important. I can select the text and use Yomichan with it. Visual Novels \u00b6 Visual Novel: Angel Beats! -1st beat- Visual Novels are very good if you hate reading books. It's helped supercharge my reading. It's similar to watching anime with Japanese subtitles. It is also good for making AnimeCards from and also serve as semi-listening semi-reading immersion. Make sure you have texthooking setup, you can find out how to do that here . To get good at reading visual novels, you just need to read more, you just need to read a lot Conclusion \u00b6 Don't worry about how much \"kanji\" you \"know\". You can start reading after you have enough listening experience, and have finished a grammar guide or something. That's all. Don't hesitate. Don't feel like you're \"not ready yet\" because you will never be if you don't start reading. Read more, read a lot, that's how you get good at reading. No hacks, no tricks, sorry.

Output is just the icing on the cake. When it comes to learning a foreign language, we usually think, \u201cOh if I speak it a lot, I will get good!\u201d. Unfortunately, this is in fact false. Immersion (input) is how you get good at Japanese. In other words, listening and reading native content in Japanese. Natural phrasing comes with thousands of hours of input (specifically listening!) . But you still have a \u201cceiling\u201d you need to reach, you can do that with speaking practice. You need to input so that you already know what\u2019s correct before speaking, because you have heard it in your input, so you will know exactly what natural thing to say before you have a conversation. With more input, your output ceiling rises, meaning you have higher output capacity. So speaking as a total beginner is pointless, your output ceiling is extremely low, so no amount of speaking practice can help you improve speaking. With a couple hundred hours more of input, your output ceiling will rise. Then you can practice speaking to hit your ceiling. You may know when you\u2019ve hit your ceiling when you try to say something but don\u2019t know how to express it naturally so you resort to translating from English to Japanese in your head using the grammar structures you memorized. When this happens it is clear you need more input. In other words if you can't think of how to express your thoughts, you need more input. After you feel confident again, you can go back to outputting. Another reason why it is bad to output early is that you don\u2019t know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and a native speaker won\u2019t inform you. So you could be making big mistakes but not realising. Maybe you don't like making mistakes. But here\u2019s why it may not be a good idea talking to natives. \u00b6 If you expect to be corrected, then you're out of luck. Natives will not correct you. It is impolite to correct someone\u2019s speech, as they could take offense to it. It is not an exclusively Japanese thing. I tend to notice unnatural phrasing in non-English natives but I do not correct them, as I could come off as a \u201cgrammar n#zi\u201d. I\u2019m sure Japanese people would feel the same about correcting your Japanese too. Most native speakers on HelloTalk and similar apps don\u2019t want to practice Japanese. They want to practice English with you. So they are stalling any chance of you ever practicing. When you do not have a decent grasp of the Japanese spoken language (e.g. understand most anime) and try to speak, it will be mistake-ridden and extremely frustrating to speak. It will be much more motivating to just immerse. Even if you ask them to correct you, they will not. Here\u2019s why it may be a good idea talking to natives \u00b6 It is fun. There is no denying outputting is fun when you are able to do it correctly. In my case when I output naturally and my Japanese friends understand exactly what I want to say, that\u2019s a motivation boost for me. And hey, if you want to speak, then do it! There is no one stopping you. It's better than speaking to learners, for sure. What if I make a mistake? \u00b6 Get over it and move on. It\u2019s not a big deal. As long as you are immersing everyday it is no big deal! Can I talk to other learners? Speaking Japanese to other Japanese learners is the WORST thing you could ever do. Because as a learner you can't tell if someone's Japanese is natural or not, so you could learn something incorrect. This can be fixed by talking with natives instead. Other Links \u00b6 AntiMoon Article Main Guide Have fun immersing! Extra Note: Reading overload \u00b6 I spoke quite a lot about how you shouldn't read until you got a lot of listening immersion. This is because it is to ensure you get a good accent in the end. The reason why you should listen to Japanese first is to build a model of how Japanese sounds in your head, to get you used to how Japanese sounds, for example how Japanese \"ra ri ru re ro\" sounds are much different than the English sounds. If you read without this knowledge, you may end up speaking with a foreign accent. Foreign accents happen when you think a sound in the target language is the same as a similar sounding sound in your native because you haven't listened long enough. It is almost impossible to read a language without applying any phonetic component to it, so even if you read in your head, you may still get this problem. Of course, if you don't care about accent, and would be fine with a gaijin accent, then you don't really need to listen. If you don't listen at all but just learn how to read that's fine if you still want to watch anime with subtitles, and just want to play VNs or whatever. Methods of approaching Japanese are never one-size-fits-all. But, I think it will really hurt your ego if you can read chuuni visual novels but can't understand simple slice of life anime, and you may not be motivated to start mass listening late because it's like, \"Why would I listen, I don't understand it. I can play so much cool VNs in Japanese so I'd rather just do that\". That's why I encourage listening right from the beginning. I hope you understand.","title":"Speaking Japanese"},{"location":"speaking/#speaking-japanese","text":"Input is the core of getting good at speaking a foreign language.

Unfortunately, this guide is more primarily focused on anime streaming sites as I do not regularly search for other forms of Japanese media; however, this method still works well for those who use any form of online streaming in the browser. If you aren't interested in anime streaming or found a site that works for you, go immediately to Starting the Setup . Finding an Anime Streaming Site \u00b6 There are many streaming sites available to you in Resources , so feel free to check them out there and get a feel for them if you plan to research and find a streaming site that best suits you. Some things to consider when looking for an online streaming site should include ensuring the video player actually works. Recommendations \u00b6 With the important stuff out of the way, let's get to the streaming site recommendation. For around a year now, I've been searching for a frequently updated, free streaming site that works for immersion learners. This included having soft subtitles/Japanese subtitles option, newly released series, large catalog, updated site, easy to navigate, and free. For the most part, many popular anime streaming sites have hardcoded subs while others had server issues too often, slow or outdated sites, paid for access, frequent adblock detection, too many ads, broken pages, etc. at least until this one particular site. Eventually, I found an anime streaming site seemed to meet all the criteria and more, and that was Anime Fever (animefever.tv). Because of this, I recommend this site for anyone looking to watch anime via online streaming. Ad-blocker Please turn on your adblocker when visiting the site! Do not use any trashy ones like ABP! Use uBlock Origin . If you are using Brave, then disable their built in ad blocker and use uBlock instead. When you visit this site, you will be greeted by a stunning UI and a page of newly released episodes, even as early as the same day that you visited the website. I took the image above on March 20, 2021, the same day episode 11 of Horimiya was released which, as you can see, is the third episode in latest releases in my screenshot. The subtitles in all the episodes are not hardcoded, meaning they can easily be turned on and off by the viewer. Which differs from it's competitors who use hardcoded subs, which are subs that cannot be modified by the viewer. Navigating the Streaming Site \u00b6 Navigate to the screenshot icon \u00b6 Result from screenshot \u00b6 The player has all the functionalities of a normal player with added features not typically found on online players such as easy in-media screenshots of the scene by clicking on the camera icon which is located underneath the progress bar, and the ability to turn off the subtitles. On it's own, it's a really good resource for those in the absolute beginner stage for the purpose of getting exposure to the language since the ability to turn off the subtitles helps the learner to focus on the dialogue and improve their ability to parse through words, which is a crucial skill for listening and speaking ability. Navigate to subtitle settings \u00b6 Downsides of Anime Fever \u00b6 The player does have some downsides to consider. As I mentioned earlier, sometimes it detects your browser's built-in adblock, so you may have to disable it. Also, you may experience a run out of memory issue from many visits to the site which means you have to clear browser cache to continue using the site; however, this issue is not very common regardless of whether you have lower end PC or not. Additionally, the maximum video quality for the site is 720p for free viewers as only subscribers are able to view in full 1080p although most free anime streaming sites cap at 720p. Info You can use sites that have hardcoded subs like Animixplay , twist.moe , Animepahe etc. if you choose, however, you will have to install another script/extension that hides subtitles behind a dark colored bar. If you have paid anime services such as Crunchyroll, use that if you prefer, but Anime Fever is a very good, free alternative to that site. Here is a general recap of what the pros and cons when considering Anime Fever for your preferred anime streaming website: Pros Cons Soft-subtitles Have to use adblock/adblock may be detected though UBlock has no issues Easy screenshots for anki cards Might experience a \"run out of memory\" error though not common for many Newly released series and large catalog Maximum quality is 720p unless you are a subscriber Honorary Mention \u00b6 Second Option If the cons outweigh the pros for you, another site to consider is MyFlixer . MyFlixer doesn't primarily focus on anime as it hosts media from around the world, so there is less options for series compared to Anime Fever. The site does contain a decent amount of series, and it has a simpler UI for those who experience memory issues/sluggish performance, and rarely detects built-in browser adblockers or UBlock Origin. The player is virtually the same to Anime Fever, except that you cannot take screenshots of the content and there is a JP subtitle option available, however, the subtitles are not selectable. Most importantly, you can turn subtitles off to replace with selectable ones. Starting the Setup \u00b6 This workflow allows you to view Japanese subtitles directly on any HTML5 video player, including anime streaming sites. This method should work for most Japanese media streaming sites or videos overall. It's ideal for those who don't want to download long-running anime with hundreds of episodes, or those who don't have the storage space to torrent anime. Nearly all episodes on the site play properly, so the workflow is a good substitute for those who use Animelon. From this point forward, it is assumed that you've already picked out your preferred anime streaming site. Before installing anything, make sure your browser is a Chrome or Chromium based browser. Now, go to the Asbplayer Github releases page, and download the latest .zip file for the Asbplayer extension. Once the download is complete, unzip the file using 7-Zip which you can download here or by using your preferred unarchiver. Unzipping extension with 7-Zip \u00b6 Now, ensure developer mode is on by navigating to chrome://extensions , or click the puzzle piece icon on the right hand side of your browser's search bar then click \"Manage Extensions\", and turn on the developer mode option on the right hand corner of the extensions page. Second way to find extensions \u00b6 Turning on Developer Mode \u00b6 Once you've done that, navigate to the left hand corner of the page and click on the \"Load Unpacked\" button. Now your file manager will appear. Navigate to the folder with the extension, or the one named asbplayer-extension-[insert current version number here] . An example is my directory which is named asbplayer-extension-0.4.2 . Highlight/click once on that folder and click the select folder button on the bottom right hand corner of the file manager. If you followed the steps correctly and have experienced no issues so far, you should see this extension show up on your extension manager page. Once you see this, go to the main Asbplayer site. Bookmark Probably a good idea to bookmark this page if you plan to stream often. First, make sure both of these options are enabled by clicking the extension on the right hand side of the browser's search bar. Display subtitles in synced video elements Record audio when copying subtitle Now, navigate to your preferred show and episode in your streaming site and download subtitles for that episode. Now, open your File Manager and drag your downloaded subtitle that corresponds to the anime that you choose into the main Asbplayer site. You should see a screen where you can see all the subtitles and the timestamps of when they are appear on the screen. If you properly pulled up the episode in the same tabs/windows prior to loading the subtitles, then you should see the progress bar when you hover towards the bottom of the browser window. Now click on that tiny little camera icon on the right hand side of the progress bar. That icon finds all the HTLM5 videos playing in your browser excluding incognito mode videos. Click on the option with the same url as the episode that you choose to view. The camera icon turns from white from grey once you designate a video for it. Now, the video and the subtitles are synced, so you can view the subtitles directly on the video itself. You can also text select the subtitles directly on the video itself rather than switching back and forth between the tabs which allows for Yomichan to be used directly on the video. If the icon does not show up after loading your video, refresh the video in a different tab and refresh the extension by going to chrome://extensions and click the reload icon next to the enable-disable button on the right hand side of the extension. The other tab highlights the current subtitle line while the video is playing. We'll get to another use of this tab in the next section. You can also put Asbplayer and the streaming site side by side, so you can easily copy the sentence of your choice to add to your deck using the copy icon on the right hand side. Switching between the two tabs works well if you get distracted by the subtitles or have two monitors, especially if you don't often add sentence cards. Important Hotkeys \u00b6 You can use these hotkeys directly on the player to navigate: Key Function Left/Right Previous/next subtitle Ctrl + Shift + Z Copy current subtitle while streaming video in another tab Space Play/Pause Grabbing Audio and Exporting Sentence Cards \u00b6 Anime Cards Make sure to manually add the image + missing fields for your card as you can't make full anime cards solely using asbplayer. Exporting Sentence Cards \u00b6 First, open your Anki application and install the Anki Connect addon. Then, navigate to: Tools -> Addons -> AnkiConnect -> Config -> \"webCorsOriginList\" Once you've headed to the configure section, you need to add the main Asbplayer site url after http://localhost and separate it with a comma like the example below. Ignore the ellipses, it's just meant to signify that there is text before this part. ... \"webCorsOriginList\": [ \"http://localhost\", \"https://killergerbah.github.io\" Click \"Ok\" once you have done this, and exit out of the addons window. Now, navigate to the main Asbplayer site. Click on the settings icon on the right hand side of the page. This should open up a window with Anki Settings for the deck and cards. Brave Common error experienced by Brave users is the Anki Connect URL showing a \"Failed to Fetch\" error. To fix this, turn off your Brave adblocker and click on the settings icon again to continue. You should no longer see this error. If you have already done this, make sure you have your Anki application open, then click \"Retry Anki URL\". Now, you can pick which deck and note type you want to choose by clicking the white arrows and clicking again on the option you prefer. You can also choose where you want the sentence field, definition field, and audio field to be located. Make sure all of this filled out, otherwise you will get a \"can't add because note type is empty\" error. Once you picked out the options, click \"OK\". Now click the copy icon on the right hand side before the timestamps of the desired subtitles. Now, click the far right menu button to open up your copy history and click the star icon in the copy history tab. Now an Anki Export window will pop up. Type in the desired definition and you should see a little \"Export Succeeded\" notice on the top of the subtitle player. Be sure not to add a duplicate card as you will get a \"cannot create note because it's a duplicate\" error. The result \u00b6 Adding the Audio Field \u00b6 The audio field will only apply if an audio source was playing when the subtitle was copied. Make sure your Anki card type has an audio field before exporting. Be sure to use Ctrl + Alt + Z as that is the only way to copy and paste audio + the sentence for the card , then navigate to the copy history menu where you should see your pasted sentence and export it with the star icon. You should now see an auto-filled audio option which you can click to playback. Click export once you've filled in all the fields. This shortcut is probably the fastest way to create a card using Asbplayer and most efficient due to the easy audio capture. This is the best workflow option for mining while streaming because using Ctrl + Alt + Z easily adds a card with audio in the copy menu for you to export. To complete the mining process, grab a screenshot by clicking the camera icon if you are using the Animecards format or any similar one. Result: [Optional] Subtitle-Configuring \u00b6 Style Settings \u00b6 The site (compatible with extension v. 0.5.0+) has a feature where users can adjust subitle color, size, outline color, outline thickness, background color, and background opacity for streaming video. To modify this, click on the settings icon, then click on the \"In-video subtitles\" tab to see all the options. To modify color, you can use the color wheel available to you, or you can Google any RGB color codes for a particular color you want. Warning Anytime you make a modification to the subtitle settings, you have to reload and reconnect asbplayer to the video. Subtitle Position Adjusting \u00b6 This feature allows you to change how low or high you want the subtitles from the screen. Some streaming sites auto-position the subtitles in odd places, such as Netflix which directly places subs on top of controls, so this can help fix that issue. To alter this, you need to open the extension menu by clicking on the extension. Now, you should see a popup menu that looks like this: Clicking on the \u2191 or \u2193 arrows or typing in the number of spaces above or below the bottom of the screen modifies the position of the subtitles. Unlike style settings, there is no need to reload and reconnect to the video when you make these changes.","title":"Anime Streaming Workflow"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#anime-streaming-workflow","text":"Contributed to TheMoeWay by Anonymous This guide will go over how to set up a workflow while streaming anime online on Chrome or other Chromium based browsers. Unfortunately, this guide is more primarily focused on anime streaming sites as I do not regularly search for other forms of Japanese media; however, this method still works well for those who use any form of online streaming in the browser. If you aren't interested in anime streaming or found a site that works for you, go immediately to Starting the Setup .","title":"Anime Streaming Workflow"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#finding-an-anime-streaming-site","text":"There are many streaming sites available to you in Resources , so feel free to check them out there and get a feel for them if you plan to research and find a streaming site that best suits you. Some things to consider when looking for an online streaming site should include ensuring the video player actually works.","title":"Finding an Anime Streaming Site"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#recommendations","text":"With the important stuff out of the way, let's get to the streaming site recommendation. For around a year now, I've been searching for a frequently updated, free streaming site that works for immersion learners. This included having soft subtitles/Japanese subtitles option, newly released series, large catalog, updated site, easy to navigate, and free. For the most part, many popular anime streaming sites have hardcoded subs while others had server issues too often, slow or outdated sites, paid for access, frequent adblock detection, too many ads, broken pages, etc. at least until this one particular site. Eventually, I found an anime streaming site seemed to meet all the criteria and more, and that was Anime Fever (animefever.tv). Because of this, I recommend this site for anyone looking to watch anime via online streaming. Ad-blocker Please turn on your adblocker when visiting the site! Do not use any trashy ones like ABP! Use uBlock Origin . If you are using Brave, then disable their built in ad blocker and use uBlock instead. When you visit this site, you will be greeted by a stunning UI and a page of newly released episodes, even as early as the same day that you visited the website. I took the image above on March 20, 2021, the same day episode 11 of Horimiya was released which, as you can see, is the third episode in latest releases in my screenshot. The subtitles in all the episodes are not hardcoded, meaning they can easily be turned on and off by the viewer. Which differs from it's competitors who use hardcoded subs, which are subs that cannot be modified by the viewer.","title":"Recommendations"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#navigating-the-streaming-site","text":"","title":"Navigating the Streaming Site"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#navigate-to-the-screenshot-icon","text":"","title":"Navigate to the screenshot icon"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#result-from-screenshot","text":"The player has all the functionalities of a normal player with added features not typically found on online players such as easy in-media screenshots of the scene by clicking on the camera icon which is located underneath the progress bar, and the ability to turn off the subtitles. On it's own, it's a really good resource for those in the absolute beginner stage for the purpose of getting exposure to the language since the ability to turn off the subtitles helps the learner to focus on the dialogue and improve their ability to parse through words, which is a crucial skill for listening and speaking ability.","title":"Result from screenshot"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#navigate-to-subtitle-settings","text":"","title":"Navigate to subtitle settings"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#downsides-of-anime-fever","text":"The player does have some downsides to consider. As I mentioned earlier, sometimes it detects your browser's built-in adblock, so you may have to disable it. Also, you may experience a run out of memory issue from many visits to the site which means you have to clear browser cache to continue using the site; however, this issue is not very common regardless of whether you have lower end PC or not. Additionally, the maximum video quality for the site is 720p for free viewers as only subscribers are able to view in full 1080p although most free anime streaming sites cap at 720p. Info You can use sites that have hardcoded subs like Animixplay , twist.moe , Animepahe etc. if you choose, however, you will have to install another script/extension that hides subtitles behind a dark colored bar. If you have paid anime services such as Crunchyroll, use that if you prefer, but Anime Fever is a very good, free alternative to that site. Here is a general recap of what the pros and cons when considering Anime Fever for your preferred anime streaming website: Pros Cons Soft-subtitles Have to use adblock/adblock may be detected though UBlock has no issues Easy screenshots for anki cards Might experience a \"run out of memory\" error though not common for many Newly released series and large catalog Maximum quality is 720p unless you are a subscriber","title":"Downsides of Anime Fever"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#honorary-mention","text":"Second Option If the cons outweigh the pros for you, another site to consider is MyFlixer . MyFlixer doesn't primarily focus on anime as it hosts media from around the world, so there is less options for series compared to Anime Fever. The site does contain a decent amount of series, and it has a simpler UI for those who experience memory issues/sluggish performance, and rarely detects built-in browser adblockers or UBlock Origin. The player is virtually the same to Anime Fever, except that you cannot take screenshots of the content and there is a JP subtitle option available, however, the subtitles are not selectable. Most importantly, you can turn subtitles off to replace with selectable ones.","title":"Honorary Mention"},{"location":"streamworkflow/#starting-the-setup","text":"This workflow allows you to view Japanese subtitles directly on any HTML5 video player, including anime streaming sites. This method should work for most Japanese media streaming sites or videos overall. It's ideal for those who don't want to download long-running anime with hundreds of episodes, or those who don't have the storage space to torrent anime. Nearly all episodes on the site play properly, so the workflow is a good substitute for those who use Animelon. From this point forward, it is assumed that you've already picked out your preferred anime streaming site. Before installing anything, make sure your browser is a Chrome or Chromium based browser.

Follow the steps below to run VNs on FreeBSD. Japanese and UTF-8 support \u00b6 By default, FreeBSD is unable to display Japanese text. Installing a Japanese font \u00b6 Make sure you have a Japanese font before proceeding. I recommend the following fonts: ja-font-ipa ja-font-koruri ja-font-sazanami ja-font-kochi ja-font-mplus-ipa ja-font-vlgothic hanazono-fonts-ttf You can install them from binary package by doing: sudo pkg install ja-font-ipa ja-font-koruri ja-font-sazanami ja-font-kochi ja-font-mplus-ipa ja-font-vlgothic hanazono-fonts-ttf You can verify that your FreeBSD system is able to display Japanese text if you can see the Japanese text below: \u3066\u3059\u3068\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u8a66\u9a13 Enabling Unicode UTF-8 \u00b6 FreeBSD also does not use Unicode by default. So Japanese filenames will be broken. You need to add these lines to your /etc/login.conf 25 26 27 28 default:\\ [...] :charset=UTF-8:\\ :lang=en_US.UTF-8: Now rebuild database for this file: sudo cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf Log out by using pkill -u $USER and log back in. KDE5/SDDM If you are using KDE, create a file called locale.sh in $HOME/.config/plasma-workspace/env/ . If the directory doesn't exist then just make it. Add the following contents: 1 2 export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 export MM_CHARSET=UTF-8 Graphics Drivers \u00b6 This is important as we will need hardware acceleration. If you haven't already installed graphics drivers on your FreeBSD system, please do that now. [AMD/ATI Radeon and Intel Graphics] [NVIDIA Graphics] Installing Wine and dependencies \u00b6 Tip If you are having issues with the binary packages, try compiling from the ports. Wine on FreeBSD has limited functionality compared to its Linux counterpart. For example, you are not able to run 64-bit applications with Wine and you also must use the i386-wine package of Wine if on an amd64 system. Do not be fooled by this name, if you are on a 32-bit system, use the regular wine package. However. lack of 64-bit support is not an issue for visual novels, as they are all 32-bit anyway. First install all the needed dependencies for Wine first, this is to ensure you don't end up in \"Wine dependency hell\": lib32 You need to have lib32 for this to work! Check if /usr/lib32 exists! If you did not get it when installing FreeBSD, get it now. On 12.2-RELEASE, get lib32.txz from [here] On 13.0-RELEASE, get lib32.txz from [here] Then run sudo tar -C / -xpf lib32.txz and then run sudo freebsd-update sudo pkg install p7zip cabextract freetype libosmesa libpcap libjpeg-turbo sane-backends ncurses ocl-icd liberation-fonts-ttf libgphoto2 json-c unixODBC nss_mdns gstreamer1-plugins-good alsa-plugins libx11 libXcursor libXi libXext libXxf86vm libXrandr libXinerama libGLU libXrender libzip lcms2 cups libxml2 libxslt flac libICE libSM libXtst libXcomposite openal-soft gtk3 libva libexif mpg123 Now, we need to install Wine: sudo pkg install i386-wine-devel We will now need winetricks , do not use the one on the FreeBSD repository as it is outdated and WILL cause headaches. Using, curl , download the latest winetricks binary. curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks --output winetricks Using chmod , make it executable. chmod +x winetricks Now copy it to your /usr/local/bin so it can be used in a command line. sudo cp winetricks /usr/local/bin Configuring Wine and installing runtimes \u00b6 Creating the Wineprefix \u00b6 First we need to create a 32 bit Wine prefix, this has the best compatibility and 64 bit doesn't even work on FreeBSD anyway. WINEARCH = win32 wineboot When Wine is started for the first time, you will need to let it install Gecko and Mono packages. Using Winetricks \u00b6 Now we need to install the common redistributables such as DirectX, Visual C++ Runtimes and .NET Framework 3.5 and other things that make video cutscenes work. Optional: Font smoothing You can do winetricks fontsmooth=rgb because without it, the font is simply awful. Optional: GUI Improvments You can open the Registry Editor using wine regedit and import this .reg file , the GUI should look nice and clean then. winetricks ffdshow quartz wmp9 d3dx9 dotnet35 vcrun2003 vcrun2005 vcrun2008 vcrun2010 vcrun2012 vcrun2013 vcrun2015 ffdshow When installing ffdshow, make sure you check (tick) \u2611 every single codec/format or else it will not work! For some VNs, such as TYPE-MOON's, LAVFilters may be needed to playback video. winetricks lavfilters ffdshow and LAVFilters Some games may break if you have both ffdshow and LAVFilters installed! Make sure you experiment! Then, run this command to disable DLL overrides, and use the native DLLs instead: winetricks alldlls = default Japanese fonts in Wine \u00b6 You need to install Japanese fonts to Wine now. Please download the pack below. [Google Drive] Unzip the file and move the font files to your Fonts folder in $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/windows/Fonts $WINEPREFIX is usually in ~/.wine . You can do export WINEPREFIX=~/.wine to use this variable. Why not install cjkfonts in winetricks? Because it doesn't work properly for VNs. Installing the visual novel \u00b6 FreeBSD does not have CDEmu, FUSEISO or anything similar, so you'll need to mount the disc image file regularly. Luckily, FreeBSD doesn't make the distinction between virtual drives and physical drives. BUT... FreeBSD does not support the simple mounting of drives without using mdconfig and EXECUTING AS ROOT! Even accessing a mounted disc image requires you to have root privileges. You cannot execute Wine as root so we will not be mounting image files. So we will be using 7zip. Extracting the ISO \u00b6 MDS/MDF If you have Alcohol 120% CD/DVD Images (MDS/MDF), you need to use tools such as mdf2iso . Common syntax is mdf2iso <source>.MDF <output>.ISO In other cases you may be able to rename the .MDF file to use the .ISO extension and it will just work. Let's first make our destination folder and cd into it. mkdir ~/extracted cd ~/extracted Now, extract it with 7z : 7z -x /path/to/<disc_image>.ISO Running the installer \u00b6 Now we can finally launch the installer with Wine.

It should usually be in /run/media/user/image_name If using a regular ISO9660 ISO file create a mount point for it. sudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom0 Now we can mount our ISO to our mount point. sudo mount -o loop file.ISO /media/cdrom0 If all went well, you will be able to see the contents of the image by doing ls /media/cdrom0 or whatever your mount point is: Running the installer \u00b6 Next, we will run the setup file using wine : LC_ALL = \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" TZ = \"Asia/Tokyo\" wine <setup_executable>.exe .msi installer If the installer executable is an .msi, run with msiexec instead of wine . Proceed with the installation. The game may be installed in $WINEPREFIX/drive_c/Program Files or wherever you chose to install it. Adding to Lutris \u00b6 Now we can add the game to Lutris so we can launch it quickly. Back in Lutris, click the plus icon in the corner, add the name of the VN, choose Wine as the runner and under \"Game Options\" navigate to the game's executable. You should also change the prefix architecture to 32-bit. AlphaROMdiE For AlphaROMdiE, you need to add AlphaROMdiE to Lutris as the executable, and the filename .exe of the Visual Novel as an argument. If you are using Wine in a command line it should look something like this: LC_ALL = \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" TZ = \"Asia/Tokyo\" wine AlphaROMdiE.exe <VN_executable.exe> For the 1st option, you must create an empty file disable_conv in the same location as AlphaROMdiE.exe, for the 3rd option, you must create an empty file other_engine in the same location as AlphaROMdiE.exe. You can do this easily by doing: touch disable_conv other_engine Vulkan Unsupported Systems If your system does not support Vulkan, you must disable DXVK in \"Runner options\", this will fallback to regular D3DX9. DXVK is a Vulkan implementation of Direct3D so we will be keeping it on even though Vulkan may not make much of a difference. Now you can just launch it in Lutris! Error: \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5165\u308c\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 Load the .ISO image with cdemu . Even though Linux can mount ISO9660 images without CDEmu, Wine programs cannot seem to find the mounted image. cdemu load 0 /path/to/image.ISO and viola! Now go back to Visual Novel Guide to learn how to use Textractor, it works perfectly under Wine. Also consider adding Textractor to Lutris for quick access. Linux: Troubleshooting \u00b6 Shift-JIS \u00b6 When you've done everything correctly but your VN text still looks like this: ????? ?????????? ???????????? This means your VN needs to use ja_JP.sjis instead of ja_JP.UTF-8. You need to download ja_JP.sjis from here first. Unzip it to a memorable location on your computer and cd into that directory. cd /path/to/ja_JP.sjis Now compile the locale using localedef : localedef -i ja_JP -f SHIFT_JIS ./ja_JP.sjis --no-warnings = ascii Using sed , edit your locale.gen to include ja_JP.sjis: sed -i '/ja_JP.UTF-8 UTF-8/a ja_JP.SJIS SHIFT_JIS' /etc/locale.gen Now generate locales: locale-gen --no-warnings = ascii You can then change the LC_ALL environment variable in Lutris to ja_JP.sjis . MPEG-1 movie does not play \u00b6 No fix found yet I spent 8 hours trying to fix this issue (I use openSUSE) with a Liar-soft VN. If you manage to find a fix, please let me know! Fuguriya VNs \u00b6 VNs made by Fuguriya such as Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o and Hanahira will not launch with Wine by default. Follow the steps below to fix this. Download fjfix [here] .

Japanese locale is the minimum requirement for running Japanese games on your Windows PC. You may use a locale emulator, though it is less of a hassle to just change system-wide locale in my opinion. Follow the steps below to set Japanese locale on your Windows system. Setting Japanese locale Open the Run dialog box by pressing Win + R Type intl.cpl and press Enter Click on the Administrative tab, go to Change system locale... and select Japanese (Japan) and click OK. Reboot your PC to apply the changes. FAQ: What about \"Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support\"? Keep it disabled. This is a recent feature of Windows 10. We do not need it for VNs, it is unrelated, and may cause problems. If you're curious: It sets codepage 65001, overriding codepage 932 (Japanese locale), we do not want this. Advanced Users: Powershell Japanese locale can also be enabled using Windows Powershell (Administrator) : Set-WinSystemLocale -SystemLocale ja-JP ; Restart-Computer This will restart your PC. Step 2. Mounting the setup files \u00b6 If you have bought your game on an optical disc, please insert the disc into your DVD drive. A new volume will appear on the Explorer sidebar, click on it and run the setup to proceed. If you bought your game as digital download, it will come in a .zip file, extract it with 7-Zip In some cases there will be no need for installation, in other cases you may need to install the game by running the setup and register with the DRM. However, if you have not bought the game, it will likely become archived in a .rar , .7z or .zip format, and within it may be disc image files. Follow the instructions below to extract and mount the setup files. Requirements: Get 7-Zip Get WinCDEmu We will be using 2 pieces of software today, 7-Zip which is a tool for making and extracting archives such as .zip , .tar and .7z files, and WinCDEmu which allows us to mount image files such as .mds/.mdf , .iso . If you have downloaded a visual novel, and it came in a .rar/.zip/.7z archive, you must extract it before you can mount the installation files. You can use 7-Zip for this. Right click the archive > 7-Zip > Extract to %folder% Above is an example of extracting the archive using 7-Zip. After the archive has been extracted, we will now use WinCDEmu to mount the image that has been extracted from it. Right click the image > Select drive letter & mount > OK After that, The disc image is now mounted. You should see a new volume appear on your Explorer sidebar. .MDS/.MDF files It is a little different if you have .MDS/.MDF files, see below. Step 3. Installing the VN and applying patch \u00b6 Click on the new volume that appeared on your sidebar and run the installer. See below for details. Proceed with the installation, you may want to take note of where you installed the game. I installed Angel Beats! into D:\\Games\\KEY\\AngelBeats! If your visual novel came with a crack, you will need to apply this crack before you are able to launch the game. Cracks often come in the form of a .exe/.dll file found in folders/archives called \"AlphaROM\" or \"NoDVD\" or simply just \"Patch\" or \"Crack\", whatever it may be, copy these files into the installation directory of the game. Please note that you will not need to do this if you have bought the game. You can find an example below. After that, you should just be able to launch the game! Now go back to Visual Novel Guide to learn how to use Textractor with Yomichan. Steam Games \u00b6 If you obtained your visual novel from Steam, first check if \"Japanese\" is listed as a supported Interface and Subtitles language on the store page first. You can then set Japanese language within the Steam client itself. Open your Steam Library. From a game's library page, select Manage > Properties. Go to the Language tab. Select Japanese from the drop-down menu. In other cases, the game language can be set within the game itself. If you did not purchase the Steam game from Steam (i.e. a cracked game) you can edit the steam_api.ini file within the game's installation directory. language=japanese Windows: Troubleshooting \u00b6 Please insert original disc \u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u5165\u308c\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 Make sure you have applied the crack/patch. Some VNs require the original disc inserted at least once before it will launch. In that case, use WinCDEmu to mount the .ISO or .MDS as a DVD drive. If the problem persists, try restarting your PC. No Crack? If there is no crack available for your VN, and your VN does not launch, use AlphaROMdiE . See pictures within .zip file for instructions. Direct3D, Visual C++ Related Issues This can be easily fixed by installing DirectX here and all the Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes here . Garbled Text (\u6587\u5b57\u5316\u3051) Solution 1: Check Japanese locale and restart your PC. Solution 2: Install Japanese fonts. Download this .zip file . Extract, press Ctrl + A (select all), Right click, Install, check \"Do this for all current items\", then Yes. Japan Time Zone Required Check Japanese locale and make sure all patch(es)/crack(s) are applied. If the problem persists, you wil need to use a locale emulator as this also emulates Japanese time zone too. This Game is Japan Only! Check Japanese locale and ensure a crack/patch is applied, if there is no crack available try using AlphaROMdiE . Or even, the Rewrite Gaijin Check Patcher, you can get that here . It's made for KEY's Rewrite but I've had success with it on other VNs too. You may also have luck using a locale emulator , as this also emulates Japanese time zone too. Cutscenes and video not working First, check if you are not using an N or KN edition of Windows. You can do that buy pressing Win + R and typing winver and press Enter . There you will see your Windows version and edition. If you are using an N edition, then you need to get the Media feature pack from Microsoft here . If you are not using a N or KN edition of Windows, then make sure the game files are installed correctly, try reinstalling the game. If the problem persists, maybe try installing ffdshow and LAVFilters Legacy Visual Novels If your visual novel is particularly old and does not work with recent versions of Windows, you can try using a Windows XP Virtual Machine Rare error: Boot failure 0xc000000f This is an issue that happens after locale settings are changed on a system that is missing NLS (National Language Support) files. If this happens to you, then it is likely you were using a unofficial modified copy of Windows . See this article to check. You can restore NLS files on your Windows system with the archive I made here . However I recommend checking the Microsoft Software Download Center for getting clean disc images for Windows. If you need to restore your system, insert a Windows recovery media and restore from a restore point. Found this useful? Consider supporting me on Patreon!

Now double click the virtual machine that has now appeared in the left menu to run the virtual machine. In the \"Select start-up disk\" dialog box, click the little folder icon, and then click \"Add\". Navigate to the disc image (.ISO) for Windows XP Professional SP3, open it and then click \"Choose\". Now click \"Start\" and wait for Windows XP to boot into the installation. You will be greeted with a blue installation screen. Don't worry. Just keep pressing the Enter key. When the initial setup is complete, Windows XP will boot into another installation screen. Wait it out. Before installation finishes, it will ask for your name, computer name, password. Just do whatever. I put \"shoui\" for every field. You will be asked to set a time zone too, do Tokyo because some VNs actually check for Japanese time zone. Once it finishes installation and reboots, you will be greeted with Windows XP setup. Enjoy the music! Click Next, then Yes, then Next, then No, then Next, then No, then put your name, then Finish.

Most VNs have anime-like sprites and visuals, and are usually accompanied by voice acting, background music and sound effects. Throughout the game, the player may be given choices, which will have an effect on how the story will play out, so if you play it a second time, with different choices, you may get an entirely different plot. Why Visual Novels? \u00b6 Reading Japanese is extremely important, but not everyone loves reading books, I am definitely one of them. I hate reading books, it\u2019s way too often I get bored when reading a regular, text-only novel. I\u2019m not much of a reader in English either. Oddly enough, I can read visual novels for hours without feeling fatigued. VNs have a mix of literary prose and conversational Japanese, so it\u2019s perfect for reading immersion. For the people that hate reading, and even find manga boring, VNs might just be perfect for you. Playing visual novels to learn Japanese \u00b6 This guide will go over how to play visual novels in Japanese and learn Japanese from them, this guide assumes you already have a Japanese visual novel set up and working, if not, check out Cross Platform VN Setup . Requirements: Download Textractor Get Yomichan Get Clipboard Inserter Texthooking Page A detailed Yomichan setup tutorial can be found here For most applications, use the x86 executable of Textractor. Steins;Gate If you wish to hook Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0, please check out Steins;Gate Textractor Launch your VN and Textractor and first remove all the unneeded extensions by pressing the Del key. Remove the following: Bing Translate Extra Window Extra Newlines Styler Regex Filter If you want to use Regex Filter, it has to be moved to the top for some reason. Now we need to attach Textractor to your VN. When it is attached, advance the text in the VN then cycle through the hooks to find the hook that matches the text displayed on the VN. Now open your browser, head over to my texthooking page make sure Clipboard Inserter is installed and enabled and then advance the text in the VN again. You can then just press Shift to use Yomichan. All done! Enjoy the reading!! You can track how much characters you have read using the indicator in the top right corner of the texthooking page. You can choose to keep the text when you refresh the page, or just the character count, or nothing. Can't hook? Try referring to the H-Code list @ Visual Novel Texthooking Wiki Please note that Little Busters! (REALLIVE.EXE) is impossible to hook. LITBUS_WIN32.EXE (Steam version) works with limited functionality however. Use a walkthrough! \u00b6 Playing a VN with a walkthrough is usually better than playing without one, because we wouldn\u2019t want to get a bad ending. You can find walkthroughs by searching \u201c[vn name] \u653b\u7565\u201d e.g. \u201cAngel Beats! -1st Beat- \u653b\u7565\u201d. Unsure what to play? \u00b6 Have a look at visual novel lists below jamal's list This infamous list Dinuz's list Have fun reading! Consider joining our VN Club in the Discord ! Bonus: Using Textractor for PPSSPP Visual Novels \u00b6 Hooking PPSSPP Visual Novels require you to use the x86 (32-bit) version of PPSSPP along with the x86 version of Textractor. Launch PPSSPP (32-bit) Launch the Visual Novel. Attach Textractor (x86) to PPSSPP (32-bit) Advance the text in the VN (O button) Using the \"Search for hooks\" feature, select \"search for specific text\" Search for the specific text that is on the PPSSPP VN. It needs to be exact. It will take a while to search for the hook, your emulator may start to lag for a while. If Textractor asks, (keep an eye on the Console) frantically advance the text (O button) on the PPSSPP VN. Now it will have found the hook. Advance the text once more (O button) Cycle through the hooks to see which hook has the newly advanced text. That's it! You could save the hook to make the process more convenient later.

As you can see, I made a dedicated tutorial for it, even though the process is simple and there are already guides out there, only so I can stress how it is a very important tool when it comes to learning Japanese. Yomichan also has extra features such as Anki flashcard creation, which makes it a powerful learning tool. Getting Started \u00b6 Yomichan is available for both Chromium and Firefox based browsers. You can find the respective versions below. Chrome Web Store Firefox Add-Ons Once installed, it will open a new tab page, just close it for now so we don't confuse each other. Acquiring Dictionaries \u00b6 When you first install Yomichan, you need to load dictionaries into it in order to use it. These come in .zip extension and are not to be extracted by the user. Download my pack of Yomichan dictionaries below. This will have everything you need and (probably) don't need. shoui Yomichan Dictionaries Pack v5 Once downloaded, extract the .7z to any location on your computer. You can use 7-Zip for this.

Jisho.org is not its own dictionary, rather it's a portal that accesses JMDict. This is the most common Japanese to English dictionary. KireiCake is based on an older version of JMDict but includes extra entries for slang. You may often see duplicate entries when used in tandem with JMDict, but for the entries that are exclusive to KireiCake, you should keep it. \u7814\u7a76\u793e\u3000\u65b0\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178\u3000\u7b2c\uff15\u7248 (Kenkyuusha New Japanese-English Dictionary, 5th Edition) is a Japanese-English dictionary intended for Japanese people.

Please come back later when this message has been removed. The appearance of the Yomichan pop-up window can be modified with custom CSS found in the settings. In the v2 settings page, it can be accessed by going into \"Appearance\" then \"Configure custom CSS\" and \"Popup CSS\" There are many, many advanced modifications you can make with custom CSS, however, I will only go through a few examples. Headword \u00b6 The headword can be modified with the classes below: /* For kanji */ . kanji-link { } /* For kana & alphanumeric characters */ . source-text { } /* For furigana */ ruby { } Furigana Color If no color is specified for the ruby selector, it will be overridden by the source-text class. Example: changing font size and color of the headword \u00b6 With the following CSS: . kanji-link { font-size : 25 px ; color : #00FBFF ; } . source-text { font-size : 25 px ; color : #FA73FF ; } The result: This demonstrates differing font colors for kanji and kana. You may edit this to your heart's content. Definition \u00b6 The definition can be modified with the class below: . glossary { } Example: changing font of definitions \u00b6 Custom Fonts To use a certain font in Yomichan, the font must be installed on your system. You can find installed fonts in: Windows: C:\\Windows\\Fonts Linux: /usr/share/fonts or /usr/share/local/fonts or $HOME/.fonts macOS: /System/Library/Fonts or $HOME/Library/Fonts Newly installed fonts may require a system restart to be detected by Yomichan. With the following CSS: . glossary { font-family : MS Mincho ; /* Japanese serif font provided in Windows */ } The result: This demonstrates the changing of font for definitions to MS Mincho. Linux users may be able to use Noto Serif CJK JP as an alternative. Font installed, but not detecting? Try using quotation marks \"\" e.g. font-family: \"07\u3084\u3055\u3057\u3055\u30b4\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\"; Example: Using DJT's quiz font (funny) \u00b6 With the following CSS: /* You must have \u8861\u5c71\u6bdb\u7b46\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u884c\u66f8 installed on your system for this to work. */ . glossary { font-family : \"\u8861\u5c71\u6bdb\u7b46\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30c8\u884c\u66f8\" ; } The result: You may edit this to your heart's content. Tags \u00b6 Tags can be modified with the classes below: . tag { } . tag-label { } . tag-label-content { } Example: Removing all tags \u00b6 With the following CSS: . tag { display : none ; } The result: You may edit this to your heart's content. Example: Changing color of tags \u00b6 You can change the color of tags by changing the following variables below: : root { /* Light Theme */ # :root[data-theme=\"dark\"] { /* Uncomment for dark theme */ --tag-text-color : -- tag-border-color : -- tag-default-background-color : -- tag-name-background-color : -- tag-expression-background-color : -- tag-popular-background-color : -- tag-frequent-background-color : -- tag-archaism-background-color : -- tag-dictionary-background-color : -- tag-frequency-background-color : -- tag-part-of-speech-background-color : -- tag-search-background-color : -- tag-pitch-accent-dictionary-background-color : } Example: Full Nord Theme \u00b6 A full Nord theme I made for Yomichan can be found below: body { background : #2E3440 ; } . kanji-link { color : #ebffff ; } . source-text { color : #ebffff ; } . glossary { color : #ebffff ; } : root { --background-color : #2E3440 ; --tag-text-color : white ; --tag-border-color : transparent -- tag-default-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-name-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-expression-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-popular-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-frequent-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-archaism-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-dictionary-background-color : #8FBCBB ; --tag-frequency-background-color : #81A1C1 ; --tag-part-of-speech-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-search-background-color : #88C0D0 ; --tag-pitch-accent-dictionary-background-color : #5E81AC ; --accent-color : #8FBCBB ; --text-color : #ebffff ; --pitch-accent-annotation-color : #ebffff ; --input-background-color : #3B4252 ; --reason-text-color : #5E81AC ; --notification-text-color : #ebffff ; --notification-background-color : #3B4252 ; --progress-bar-track-color : #D8DEE9 ; --light-border-color : #E5E9F0 ; --sidebar-background-color : #2E3440 ; --sidebar-button-background-color : transparent ; --sidebar-button-background-color-hover : #81A1C1 ; --sidebar-button-background-color-active : #6d88a3 ; --sidebar-button-danger-background-color : transparent ; --sidebar-button-danger-background-color-hover : #BF616A ; --sidebar-button-danger-background-color-active : #8a373f ; --sidebar-button-icon-color : #ebffff ; --sidebar-button-disabled-icon-color : #808c8c ; --sidebar-button-danger-icon-color : #ebffff ; } :: -webkit-scrollbar { display : none ; } The result: Background \u00b6 Background can be edited with the selector below: body { } Example: Changing background color \u00b6 With the following CSS: body { background : #FFA8F8 ; } The result: You may edit this to your heart's content. Using image as background \u00b6 Chromium instructions for now To do this, you must install Yomichan dev build from GitHub instead of the Chrome Web Store, this is because we will be tampering with the files of the extension, which will be flagged if you get it from the Chrome Web Store. You can find it below. [GitHub] Yomichan Data All Yomichan data including dictionaries will be reset, you may be able to just copy the files over from your current Yomichan installation though. Download yomichan-chrome-dev.zip and unzip it anywhere on your computer. Now go to chrome://extensions and enable Developer Mode in the top right. Now click \" Load Unpacked \" and select the folder the .zip was extracted to. Now go to your Yomichan path which should be the same place you unzipped it and put your desired image in the fg folder. Now you can do the following CSS below. body { background-image : url ( \"name_of_file.png\" ) !important ; } The result: Miscellaneous \u00b6 Some misc. modifications you can do which I found cool. Removing current entry indicator \u00b6 Since Yomichan was updated, a blue indicator has been added. Which has been an annoyance for many long time Yomichan users. With the following CSS: . term-expression-current-indicator { display : none ; } The result: Removing progress bar \u00b6 With the following CSS: . top-progress-bar-container { display : none ; } Indicator and progress bar colors \u00b6 Alternatively, if you don't like the current color of the indicator and bar, you can change it rather than removing it. You can add the pseudo-class selector and custom property below: : root { --accent-color : #FF00DD ; /* Change color to a pink */ --progress-bar-track-color : #00F7FF ; /* Change bar track color to a blue */ } If you are using dark theme you need to have this instead: : root [ data-theme = \"dark\" ] { The result: Removing Edict markers \u00b6 In Edict dictionaries such as JMdict and KireiCake, there are markers that look like \u25cb which can be annoying for some. You can remove it by using the CSS below: . term-glossary-list { padding : 0 ; list-style-type : none ; } The result: Light / Dark mode varying CSS \u00b6 An example of varying CSS for light / dark modes can be found below. : root [ data-theme = \"dark\" ] { --glossary-color : #a89984 ; --ruby-color : #b8bb26 ; --kanji-text-color : #fabd2f ; --background-color : #282828 ; --accent-color : #689d6a ; --progress-bar-track-color : #458588 ; } : root { --glossary-color : #504945 ; --ruby-color : #98971a ; --kanji-text-color : #d79921 ; --background-color : #fbf1c7 ; --accent-color : #689d6a ; --progress-bar-track-color : #458588 ; } . kanji-link { font-family : UD Digi Kyokasho N-R ; } ruby { color : var ( --ruby-color ); } . source-text { font-family : UD Digi Kyokasho N-R ; } . term-glossary { color : var ( --glossary-color ); }","title":"Yomichan Custom CSS"},{"location":"yomicss/#yomichan-custom-css","text":"This is an optional tutorial.
